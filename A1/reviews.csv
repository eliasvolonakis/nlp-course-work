Now that I need to prepare myself for the real Microsoft Exam , I have nothing! Appaling! Please, stay away and do not trust this company! Wast of your money! ""Dishonesty"" light flashing warning!"
Udemy,2023-01-25T17:49:17.000Z,1,"Poor quality teaching. For work update skills, I enrolled on a few courses yet they were below standard. One chap was always referring to his book, and saying ""I'll talk about that"" etc yet would then talk from his book. Unsure at what point he'd ""talk about that"" bit he was referring to. Following a refund request, udemy credited my account. Today I ask them to refund me as a credit means they hold MY money. Udemy said the 30 day rule meant they were unable to refund me. I enrolled on at least two or three courses, yet really, the standard was quite poor."
Udemy,2023-01-23T08:08:42.000Z,1,"I spent over a hundred dollars on courses for my daughters and they didn't start the courses right away and when they went to, they couldn't. I wrote them. I sent copies of my bank statement to show where I paid. And for each course. There were quite a few. I did everything but they wouldn't tell me how they girls could get into the courses I purchased and they wouldn't refund my money. I think it's a scam. If you get a course, better start it right away or they'll take it away from you. Over a hundred dollars wasted. And they didn't care. Worst customer service ever. Worst online shopping experience ever. Waste of money. Waste of time. I recommend looking elsewhere and not to sign up for any classes here. I would give zero stars if I could."

Udemy,2023-01-11T12:16:04.000Z,3,"Indeed, Udemy helped me to become a self-taught web designer, but they often praise and hype mediocre courses on their landing page. Initially, I wasted a lot of money on courses with high ratings to discover that their contents were redundant to others. Meanwhile, I turned away from their online tutorials because some of Udemy's teachers generate themselves as superstars, at least the ones listed as the most popular. I'm an online teacher myself (not on Udemy), but I try to stay more down-to-earth."

I lost just time, Udemy did stupid refund, without consider the damage that I got, I have 20hr note without finish any course, and I now I have to start with another one. First Dr. Bright should be Ban, He need refund the damage to the people that already bought his courses. Second , I don't have trust anymore in Udemy because , you buy a course, and in any moment the tutor can cancel the course. You have just lose money and time.After some investigation, I contacted Dr. Bright who told that in reality ""Udemy have cancel his course in one night"". This is agaist the contract, can take legal action , Udemy garante the life access to their courses, in this case, they have cancel what I have already paid."

I just spent 250 € my own money on their courses, my plan was to watch them during commuting to work, but this did not work. Udemy, you let me down. You have not answered to my help desk messge 3 weeks ago. Get your s**t working, please!!"
Udemy,2022-12-26T08:47:11.000Z,1,"Never again. Sheer incompetence from their support team, and the audacity to require that the customer do the work for them. I purchased a gift for my sister to be delivered by email on 12.25. The gift was not delivered, and customer service said they cannot send her the gift because she does not have an account with them. They should have told me that at the time I purchased the gift. But no. Instead, they tell me to do all the work. If they cannot accommodate gifting of their products, so be it, but they shouldn't put the burden of this onto the consumer.  Their online chat person, Ned, was virtually useless. Stay away from this backwards company that does not care about the consumer."

A professional course with professional terminology"". Nope. Everything that was taught could be gone through within 20 minutes max and also its pretty much what you learn when you went to mandatory schooling.Here is a direct quote from Udemy: ""I'd like to clarify that Udemy is not an accredited institution.""So there. If you want to be certified or get a diploma in ANYTHING, do not use Udemy. The Proofreading & Editing ""course"" that I took was an absolute scam."

I created a free course and decided to change it to paid, but a few weeks later, when I tried to switch back to making it free, I couldn't: they'd changed the rules! Now Udemy makes 10 bucks every time they sell one of my courses, I get like 1.50$."

Udemy,2022-10-22T22:08:28.000Z,1,"Tech support seem to have only made it out of elementary tech school. Repeatedly provided relevant information, they repeatedly ask me for it again and again.  Good news: I couldn't get past the signup screen. At this point, in the time expended (losing $$$), I would rather pay much more for a program that is solid, informative, and at my level. What a waste of time."

I had not been charged for the next month, I cancelled and confirmed free trial cancelled yet they charged - and as per requirements to law wouldn't refund unused portion of the pre-paid amount (which was the entire thing). It's not the money it's the fact that these companies think they can hide behind not having to follow legal requirements."

No matter how I price my course, Udemy ignore this and simply pays me cents for my hard work. This is either deliberate corporate theft or a 'simple computer glitch'. Be warned!UPDATE! Since complaining to Udemy and lodging this review my sales have stopped completely! Retaliation? Coincidence?"
Udemy,2023-01-02T18:52:19.000Z,1,DO NOT BUY. Your gift will not be sent. No customer service. They will take your money and leave you out to dry
Udemy,2022-10-04T23:20:05.000Z,2,"Be careful when purchasing courses.   Prices will increase quickly...they call it dynamic pricing, however, support cannot tell you how it works.    I personally saw the price of course increase in minutes from one user to another.   Unacceptable!    Set the price and set it for everyone....stop increasing prices as you see more people looking at the course or putting the course in their cart.   Completely shady and a lack of integrity."
Udemy,2022-11-23T20:11:54.000Z,1,"Very strange things going on with how they price their courses. Basically, they will put up fake exaggerated prices of multiple times the real price, pretending that there is a giant promotion and you're getting an 85% discount or whatever. Lies. They then proudly claim that the courses can be refunded within 30 days, which is NOT HONORED! If you read the fine print, they can deny the refund if  ""a significant portion of the course has been consumed or downloaded"". What is ""a significant portion""? Whatever the hell they decide. Hence you can NEVER be safe to get your money back as promised, and you should CERTAINLY not make the mistake of going through a ""significant"" part of the course before demanding a refund."
Udemy,2022-10-04T02:57:21.000Z,2,"The courses are ok, but if you have credit, they will not refund you. Even if you closed your account. I had 124$ in credit and they said they cannot refund that. Even though it's unused. Pretty much steals your money, don't put money for cheaply made courses that can be found on YouTube for free, because they will steal your money"

I think they are just happy they sell courses. Be careful."

When I was browsing for courses the site indicated that there was a special offer on basically every course. However when I went to checkout and signed up, all of a sudden it was gone even though it said there was still five hours left on the special offers. Because od this I almost payed 84 euros for a course instead of 15. I can't help but think this was intentional because as soon as I made an account the offers were gone."

Udemy takes over 80% of the profit. I have been with Udemy since March 2022 and it is not getting any better.  I would NOT recommend to waste your time writing a course and post it on Udemy - they make money on your work and give you peanuts which is not fair.

Asked about the credits and have been told that there is nothing they can do and their decision is final.

I was then told that the money had been refunded ... in ""credits"".In other words once they have your money they won't be paying it back despite claims to the contrary and postings on their site. There is No email address, no service support and no comeback."
Udemy,2022-01-09T03:23:44.000Z,5,"I have a lot of different courses on Udemy. Most are really good. There are some that are lacking for some reason or another. But, overall  I found a great deal of great content. Most of the courses range around 15 dollars when they are on sales(which is most of the time). If the price is $200 just wait a week or so it will go on sale. It better then paying $60 on amazon for a book that way outdated. Most people update their couses on a regular basis. Plus, they have access to all the content in their site."
Udemy,2021-06-30T21:46:38.000Z,5,I couldn't be happier with the courses and customer service from Udemy.comI had an issue recently with a duplicate account and needed a merge done it was handled so well by a lovely technical support person called Chris. I was really stressed about not being able to access my courses and probably a bit snappy and Chris was so patient and understanding and resolved the issue so fast! Amazing service!
Udemy,2022-11-07T12:14:03.000Z,1,"Paid for the personal plan, the system wouldn't let me attend any courses on the plan. Tech support offers no help at all and just offers boilerplate responses."
Udemy,2021-07-17T09:14:31.000Z,1,"Against better knowledge, I decided to try to book another course with Udemy as the course I was going for had up-to-date reviews (especially concerning the response proclivities of the course leader). It was advertised for a price of 19.99 when I had found it, and then, as soon as I tried to buy it it had jumped to GBP 59.99. Yeah, sorry, that is not happening."
Udemy,2021-07-06T07:14:40.000Z,1,"USELESS!!!You can't even log in.They have such stupid security measure that you're being locked out of your own account.""YOUR ACCOUNT IS IN SAFE MODE.RESET PASSWORD"" and after you reset the password you get the same message again and again and again and...This shi*ty security policy makes the platform useless, unusable.What the hell am I suposed to do now?I can only login on the udemy app but I can't use my PC.Can't believe they never heard of 2FA."
Udemy,2021-06-26T16:25:51.000Z,1,"A scam of a learning experience! Unbelievable that the 30 day money back guarantees will only refund a certain number. If I had known I would not purchase this. The courses haven’t even been accessed. This is in violation of consumer rights and I feel disgusted thinking this company was legitimate before. Many of the courses themselves are of poor quality learning material that I have figured out more of myself, not of a professional quality and poorly delivered."
Udemy,2022-08-28T20:33:36.000Z,1,"I wanted to learn with them, but their courses are low quality, the authors are not real professionals, and many courses I followed were created by non-native English speakers, with accents from around the world, which makes them difficult to follow, and makes the comprehension of the material less useful, not to mention that some are ignorant in the thing they create and it becomes useless videos.For example, one Spanish author pronounces ""apache"" (the web server) as ""apak"", which is very annoying, anyone who really uses that server knows how to pronounce the name correctly, and naming it ""apak"" is just clear ignorance, I stopped and didn't finish the rest of the course.In short, try to avoid this site."
Udemy,2021-07-18T11:54:58.000Z,1,"Rabbish is another name for Udemy. The video bar keeps blinking, which is very distracting, and annoying, and they have not fixed it for more than a year now! Also I can not edit a question I asked, there is no 3 dots for questions in Q&A under courses, as its mentioned in their Support section. Instead they sit there, changing colors!!! Let alone that there is no customer service to contact and send feedback, and I should use this platform to share my feedback! Rabbish."
Udemy,2021-07-13T18:53:08.000Z,5,"I have found the Udemy courses really helpful for some of my Azure training and certifications.  Also, I like the fact that I bought a course and did not complete most of it for over a year, due to inertia on my part; and when I restarted I found the content had been updated, excellent!  The prices are good,  I've never needed/wanted to claim a refund so I can't comment on that side as I see some other reviews have highlighted.I do wish they had an Azure DP-300 course."
Udemy,2021-12-18T08:10:26.000Z,1,"I bought a course and completed it but no certificate was issued. Then I sent them a support request.

Udemy,2021-06-02T22:00:26.000Z,1,"I took a Udemy course a few weeks ago to learn Squarespace.""Create a website without writing code"". Invested 5 hours of my time and wrote 15 pages of notes. Guess what? That course was created for a former version of Squarespace and everything I learned is USELESS. They changed their interface to version 7.1 last year! Udemy should NOT still be offering this course nor accepting payment for this waste of time. And I cannot get a refund because I completed the course."
Udemy,2021-09-08T15:47:50.000Z,5,"I could not afford to pay for the original course to obtain the certificate from an instituion. I was told about Udemy and I found the needed course on Udemy and decided to try it out. I purchased a course presented by Asif Ahmed. It was a good course, giving me the essential knowledge I need to use the software."
Udemy,2022-04-16T09:12:46.000Z,3,"The courses are good and many (but not by them. So they don't really deserve the credit for that) but that's it.Safety isn't top-priority. It's 2022 and there's still no 2FA. Someone guesses your password, bye bye pricey courses.Also, the mobile app is worthless. Nothing more than a videoplayer with half baked useless features that annoys you daily with a notification to tell you there's a sale ending soon.Still.. There's a lot of choice in courses and if you use the (a little less secure) website then it's not all bad.. But there is definitely a LOT of room for improvement."

Udemy,2021-10-05T13:12:26.000Z,1,I was user of Udemy courses from 2019. Was happy with the course content. But as Udemy expanded customer support became pathetic. Sometimes the courses are also bad. I had a wallet with udemy. I was Unhappy with the courses and asked for refund.They changed the refund policy and replied they cannot refund. In spite of repeated requests I did not get reply. I had a wallet with Udemy with money loaded in wallet. I requested to credit my money back. I have written 5 times over 6 months and I am yet to get reply
Udemy,2021-07-15T00:25:25.000Z,5,This is one of the best online courses platforms ever. It contains a lot of courses in every single field. Some of them offer certified certificates beside the certificate you get from the website itself. Prices are very cheap compared to other platforms. Also I found a lot of free courses there. I highly recommend it.
Udemy,2022-01-01T20:12:38.000Z,1,"I purchase 2 IT Recruiter courses. They were both so bad, I had to stop watching them after 30 minutes. They are so basic, and horribly uninformative. I complained but all they wanted to do is give me COURSE CREDIT> Save your money PLEASE  do not use them, They are honestly horrible"
Udemy,2021-07-12T23:59:56.000Z,1,"I took a class for $49.99, I missed the deadline to request a refund, because it wasn't what I have expected, Udemy.com refused to issue a refund or credit. After I completed the course, I received a request to retake the same course for $14.99. Udemy is engaging in price gouging. Their customer service is very poor."
Udemy,2022-03-23T01:32:17.000Z,1,"Paid for Autocad 2017 #1 and Autocad 2017 #2 and started lesson #1. Got an error message the course was no longer available, contact customer service. Wrote about the issue and nothing. Beware of this company ripping off customers on courses that aren't available."
Udemy,2021-06-18T17:44:58.000Z,1,"As others have said the pricing is a total scam. They advertise a course at a heavily reduced price but then you add it to your cart and find the price has jumped by 400% (make sure you check or you will be in for a shock bill).Basically if are already registered with them then you pay full price, new customers get the discount.Wouldn’t mind if they made this clear but they don’t, you see a reasonable price, add to cart and only at that point does the price rocket. A dishonest and untrustworthy practice."
Udemy,2021-08-23T15:07:32.000Z,4,"I have bought a couple of courses from udemy. They are great for getting general knowledge on a subject relatively quickly in a structured manner. If you want to get more in-depth knowledge though, I wouldn't recommend. The business model doesn't encourage really in-depth content, in my opinion."
Udemy,2021-06-05T21:18:13.000Z,5,Asif Ahmed's inventor knowledge is too good. It helped me to improve my work. So far I have acquired his 5 course and in future I may take more. His teaching technique and slowly teaching and explaining techniques are quite good to understand topic. I encourage other friends who wants to learn inventor.
Udemy,2021-06-22T13:51:35.000Z,1,I purchased 2 Courses with 30 days money back guarantee but when i did ask for a refund i was told that you can purchase another course but cant have your funds back in your original payment method as i did select the udemy credit....so be careful as there is no support or help by udemy afterwards.
Udemy,2021-07-06T09:49:04.000Z,1,"I’ve previously enjoyed some of the courses from Udemy. However a couple of weeks ago they took money from a course that they then didn’t deliver. They are being deliberately obtuse with trying to resolve the situation, repeatedly rejecting evidence of the purchase which I have gathered following their instructions. I don’t understand a business mode based on destroying customer trust. I had spent a lot of money with them, but never again. My advice is to seek alternative providers of training courses. There’s no shortage!"

Udemy,2022-06-17T16:08:29.000Z,1,"Unfair revenue sharing with instructors,  every course Udemy's revenue is almost double of the instructors. Even getting most revenue from the instructors, Udemy does not defend the basic rights or dignity of the instructors."
Udemy,2021-07-08T12:36:10.000Z,1,"Do not use. I enrolled on Apache Cordova - Build Hybrid Mobile App for Android & iOS and found videos missing (see section 4 of the course). After asking instructor, I was told to wait a week and then a few days as the videos were being uploaded. I was kept waiting and waiting and now the 30 days are up. I am looking for money back but do not hold any hope. I feel that I was asked to wait for the videos to appear so that the 30 days were up and Udemy had my money. I had heard good reviews from others but this course is awful - wasted money."
Udemy,2022-01-21T15:13:38.000Z,2,"I published a course in 2020 and honestly didn't have a great experience, the fees are not transparent. For example, one month I sold 60 courses and I only made $300 USD (when my course was supposed to cost $20 USD each) and I referred most of the sales. The organic traffic is really low, from the 60 courses I sold, only 2 were ""organic"" and the rest were followers of my social media channels. Also, as a teacher, you don't have access to the data of your students (emails). I ended up changing to Kajabi, better service and they are well aware that teaching is also a business so my knowledge is worth more."
Udemy,2021-11-18T21:42:32.000Z,1,"UDEMY IS A SCAM!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY. I BOUGHT A COURSE 5 DAYS AGO. THE COURSE WAS TERRIBLE AND VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. I SENT THEM A REQUEST AND IT WAS IGNORED. I KEPT TRYING TO LISTEN TO THE INSTRUCTOR IT LITERALLY GOT WORSE. I FINALLY HAD ENOUGH AND REQUESTED A FULL REFUND. THEY DENIED IT ALTHOUGH I HAD ONLY GONE 19% THROUGH, THEIR OWN WEBSITE SAYS A ""SIGNIFICANT PORTION NEEDS TO BE USED"" 19% IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. SECONDLY, THEY PROMISE 30 DAYS, WHAT A LIE. DO NOT EVER USE UDEMY. I AM CONTACTING MY BANK AND LET THEM HANDLE IT. I AM ALSO POSTING THIS TO TRUSTPILOT, GOOGLE REVIEWS, YELP AND BBB."
Udemy,2021-07-04T09:38:26.000Z,1,Terrible experience as an instructor: started the verification process on 05/06/21 and faced a huge delay due to some problems with my account - as of 04/07/21 haven't got any info what to do next.I have been contacting them many times but all I could get was to wait for a reply. When I get a reply once a fortnight it simply states that there is a problem.When I wanted to complain it's turned out they don't have a complaint department.I have now missed the opportunity to release the course since it was specifically timed for the exam period. Can't recommend at all.
Udemy,2021-11-20T03:45:21.000Z,1,"Udemy lies about the pricing of their courses. Never buy unless their is a ""SALE"". Deleted my cookies and browser history and got a ""SALE"" with 5 hours left. Had to log in and the course was back to full price. This seems predatory and very unethical."
Udemy,2021-07-28T10:23:54.000Z,3,"Udemy is not bad when it comes to courses I bought a couple courses to try out. I was going to buy a few more but they said the “promotion” is over. The regular prices for the courses I would not purchase IT’S TOO EXPENSIVE. I found the same course I wanted on “Skillshare” that’s a bargain for you buck as it’s a set fee and unlimited education. At the promotional pricing that Udemy had, I think that is fair and better than Skillshare but without the promotions Udemy takes an L compared to its competitors. UDEMY IF YOU GUYS DON’T HAVE ANY PROMOTIONS YOU AIN’T GETTING ANY OF MY MONEY!"
Udemy,2022-12-09T04:50:08.000Z,1,"Their subscription plans are very misleading.  I was excited about a course and decided to sign up for the monthly subscription instead of buying the individual course.  When I did, the option to take the course I was excited about disappeared.  I tried logging out and searched the topic again and it came up in the course options.  That’s when I realized they only give access to a limited amount of classes with their subscription.  And they are their lesser classes. It feels very intentionally misleading.  I decided to cancel my subscription.  I had only purchased it within the hour and hadn’t taken any courses yet, but didn’t refund my money.  After contacting customer care, I was told they don’t provide a 30 day guarantee.  I told them I would need a refund and had made the purchase less than thirty minutes prior and felt their practices are misleading and shady.  I got a canned response that they have to protect their teachers.  Obviously not relevant to my situation so I asked to have the situation escalated and was told I’d get an email.  Such a disappointing experience.  I won’t be recommending Udemy or taking any of their courses."

The courses are great but the platform is absolutely horrible. The most unfriendly, platform I have ever seen. They have this discount but I guess it is for nobody. I guess I will just move on from this.If people from Udemy sees this, just do the bare minimum and make your platform useable, I am really not expecting a fancy website or design, I just want to be able to log. Wow, I have such low expectations from you, that's a shame"
Udemy,2021-11-27T15:05:38.000Z,1,"Absolutely unethical organization. Those 'sales' are usually ongoing and 'only 1 day left', huge discounts ... You can see this for weeks, and so-called original price is much, much more than it should be. And if you add a course to favourites and don't do anything with it, that 'sale' is turned off. Just open incognito in your browser and search for it, and oh surprise - 'sale' is still there.Moreover, during promotion weeks they hide free / paid filters from search. This company good is only good in getting your money and nothing more. Better go to other sites. It could be more pricey, but they are fair and have quality control."

I signed up for a course and completed all of the course contents including quizzes and practice exercises.  Then when it came time to request my certificate they said I didn't complete all of the courses assignments and quizzes!!??  I paid for the subscription for 4 months  and after all the money spent and all of the hours I put into completing the course, they come back with nothing.  Udemy is a joke and a fraud.  Whomever used their services and didn't get the certificates after completing a course should contact me so we can arrange to file a class action lawsuit because thieves like Udemy should not be permitted to operate a fraudulent, deceptive, and misleading business."

(Example: Enter Turkey DNS)2 - Browse that course again from a different browser.The course price is now $2.Turkey is fighting the economic crisis, and they are selling all courses to this country very cheaply. As a Canadian resident, I have to pay $98 more for the same course. Isn't that stupid?I can buy this course for $2 and sell it to someone else for $50 because those living in Canada will still buy it for $100 if they don't know the DNS change method.Change DNS and make Turkey.

Udemy,2021-11-07T07:37:26.000Z,1,Useless customer support. Have had a number of transactions declined. Bank has assured no issue on their end. Card details autofill so no issue with wrong information. Udemy customer support seem unable to answer direct questions.
Udemy,2022-08-19T18:37:55.000Z,1,I have taken 5 courses on Udemy as I'm trying to progress my art. The first course was a very basic course and I had to ask for a refund under the 30 days money back guarantee. I didn't realise Udemy is very very sneaky and dishonest and refunds the money as a credit so you can purchase another course rather than avail the money to the original mode of transfer. I have tried sending email to Udemy and find beyond belief  there is no phone number or actual customer service email to corrospond. This is one scamster site I should have done my due diligence before hand.  I would aware everyone to first look into reviews and testimonies online until one is satisfied to go ahead and spend their hard earned money. I don't even feel like taking the rest of the course as I'm just disgusted with this fraudulent website.
Udemy,2022-04-23T15:57:12.552Z,5,I don’t understand all the bad reviews !!I find their courses to be superb & excellent value for money.Ps: if you don’t trust them due to all these bad reviews just buy a short cheap course as a test :-)

Udemy,2022-05-20T22:07:09.000Z,5,"After going through a few reviews about Udemy here, I was shocked to see a lot of bad reviews. I have been a customer to Udemy since 2020 and have bought so many courses from them and they are of good quality.You can get courses as low as single digits during their promo periods.I think many people do not want to do the right either by deliberate actions or by ignorance and so they got their fingers burnt in the process. Hence, the rants.If you are new to Udemy and desiring to buy or list a course, simply read up their terms and conditions and play by the rules and you will be fine.I have not found anything bad with Udemy so far. There are free courses listed for those who want to try a few freebies out. Whatever you do, DYOR well enough so you dont get your fingers burnt."
Udemy,2022-09-26T16:22:22.000Z,5,"I can see Udemy has garnered some negative reviews for various reasons... But for me, as a buyer, it's been a positive experience. Firstly, I only enrol on reputable courses that are updated regularly. Anything outdated or without many reviews is less likely to get a purchase from me, because it can lead to issues that negative reviewers have mentioned. But saying that, I may take the occasional risk, as new instructors deserve that chance. There are some incredible courses on Udemy, particularly some of the bootcamp courses in software and web development that have been better than my expensive university education. I really enjoy the learning and it's honestly turning my life around. The great thing is you can focus on learning the skills you actually enjoy doing.Udemy run regular discounts where you're paying little to nothing for the courses. £12.99 for an extensive bootcamp course is awesome. Highly recommended."

Didn't notice an option for cash, it must have been hidden or subtle compared to the apparently pre-selected ""credits"" option.Essentially a scam, as they clearly state refunds are available but have completely prevented me from getting one.Further, a lot of the courses on there are garbage, even very highly rated courses. Although, some are good I admit. However, they tend to be only focused towards beginners.Also, they have awful price practices and sales.Finally, after trying to contact them regarding my ""refund"", I failed to do so. They've got an awful support system and it seems very difficult to even message them."
Udemy,2022-03-08T16:39:01.000Z,1,"It has a lot of courses but the 'sale prices' change from person to person. My colleagues and I bought a course on the same day and some of us paid 13€, while others paid 11€, 14€ and even 19€."

This is fundamental to make sure you choose the right course, since not all of them are good and up to date.Unfortunately, the certificate you get after completing a course is not recognized, it's just a personal achievement, but what really matters is your actual knowledge.Another big advantage is the fact that you can buy just single courses with no need to pay for an annual or monthly subscription.Overall, I would definitely recommend Udemy, just giving the advise to check the courses well before buying them."

Demanding course descriptions be a certain length and bios be a certain length. After following their crazy demands right before launching the course they ask for very personal information. Like your address, phone number, date of birth. This was very weird to me and came across scummy and illegal. Then they asked for a picture of my ID, driver's license or passport to apparently verify who I am. I contacted the business about these illegal practices their doing.

Udemy,2022-01-15T09:36:48.000Z,2,"Get some good courses, get some bad courses. My main issue is the way certification is displayed for CV's. As this is a review directly to udemy and has nothing to do with instructors on the website. Showing the time of videos on the certificate just looks terrible on a CV and does not include the following. Time when videos needed to be paused to take notes. Some courses examination. Additional research done online as required by some courses and not included in the course itself. As well as the total time of the course being split up into multiple days of study instead of for example a one 8 hour day. Not even to mention lunch breaks etc. All of these factors and more just make us feel the time displayed on the certificate IS NOT the actual time spent on the course. And like mentioned looks terrible on a CV."
Udemy,2021-06-12T09:03:17.000Z,5,I love Udemy and have always had a positive experience buying. You have to make sure to preview the course as early as possible to make sure its right for you before continuing.

Udemy,2021-07-21T21:53:53.000Z,2,Awful company; they confiscated my Udemy credits after telling me there was a limit on refunds. So not 30 days as advertised.You can find much of the material free on YouTube.
Udemy,2022-05-21T23:20:52.000Z,1,"where do i start - I've done quite a few courses here, but finding that the value of the courses don't really match the quality of the course, glad that in so many cases I've taken advantage of the vouchers or promo to get the course reduced.Am very annoyed with udemy that the videos are done by the lecture that their language isn't English and there fast in trying to speak and teach the course in there second language , had to come away from those courses , painful to my ears, impossible  couldn't understand a word and learn at the same time...madness on a scale off the scales. Having now read many reviews and written many reviews , I would now consider in going forward in asking for money back, even if it were highly reduced fee, beginning to think that a highly reduced course is because of that very reason , so if I fall into that trap will aim for refund. No more second ,third, forth chances."
Udemy,2021-12-14T02:16:37.000Z,5,"The platform is full of professionals almost in any sector and in anything, and the classes are the greatest I've seen. I've gained a lot of knowledge from this site."

Udemy,2021-06-24T09:20:35.000Z,4,"Been taking the course during the pandemic, it was quite initiative and helped me in gaining new skill. Very useful if anyone is looking to learn new skill in a meantime."

Udemy,2021-05-30T16:49:38.000Z,2,"I have done two photoshop courses (for free on udemy, actually, the second course is still under way). The first by Stephan Koel which is a basic course was pretty good once you got attuned to his English. The second complete course in photoshop is taught by someone with extremely poor spoken English, both grammar and pronunication. She is an awful on line tutor from the CADCIM institute, who keeps correcting herself, and has also submitted some videos which are technically unwatchable. She also offers no explanation for what she does, and it is only suitable to learn parrot style. That said, one or two of the techniques she has shown are proving useful. You have to have a lot of patience to get through this course as some of the lessons may have very little relevance to the general user. This was ok for free, but I am glad I did not pay for this poor verbal presentation."

Udemy,2021-12-13T07:23:53.000Z,5,"I've only tried the free courses, but they're quite interesting. I can't speak for the rest of the organisation, but their free content is fantastic."

Udemy,2022-01-13T09:33:30.000Z,2,"Not trustworthy.Be aware that Udemy fools you from the second you visit their website. Offers that 'only last 1 more day' actually last for the rest of the year and beyond. Every time you visit their website, you get this 'offer' and actually, it's not an offer. (they add 8% before they give discount, you know the trick)Be very aware of what you are buying. We (4 people) have been scouting about 200 courses in the software and media development region. Most 'teachers' are so full of themselves, they actually forget to inform you about the 'do's and don't's' in software development.42% of the 'teachers' approached, do not respond to questions, they just want (your) easy money.If you are looking for a place to learn about software or media development, this is definitely not the place to go.You're better of searching for stuff you really need on the web. There's like a billion people out there that are glad to help you, for free."

Udemy,2022-01-24T09:17:17.000Z,1,"Firstly, they are impossible to contact once they have your money. No customer service whatsoever.Secondly, the course that I purchased was billed as a ""2021"" course on flutter app development. Within the platform a massive change had occurred in March 2020 but as the course was actually made three years ago it didn't deal with this change and it rendered a significant amount of the more advanced content pretty obsolete. So the course was sold on a lie.Finally, I was promised that I could watch the course on my TV.However, as Udemy aggressively pushes cookies my android TV won't let me open their website.So, I want to contact them about this and they have become uncontactable. No email, no Twitter DMs allowed, no telephone support. Not even quick chat.If I can ever get in touch with them to get my refund within the 30 day period I will possibly edit the review but that looks unlikely.They may be a genuine company but they behave in a very scammy way"

Udemy,2021-05-28T15:31:56.000Z,2,"Most of their promotions are a sham, they just highlight it as the best sale of the season but when you check most of the popular/high rated courses, the price will never reflect that sale price. When you question them, you will meet with a series of generic responses (their response time is pathetically slow). Even escalations will not lead you anywhere (not sure why they have that provision). They will state that they will do a partial refund but that will never work (refer to many reviews from others - if you are lucky and survive the numerous attempts to get someone to respond, they only offer udemy credits and not give you back the money). Better use other education provider sites that are transparent on their pricing and have better support system. It's way easy to enroll and learn...instead of wasting your time following up with Udemy's support team. They don't even have a phone number to speak to someone....seriously?"
Udemy,2022-03-18T10:23:05.000Z,1,"A very absurd act of Udemy! I'm Vietnamese in Russia, I've been buying and studying udemy's courses all year. I paid all for a course and it is Udemy's obligation to deliver the course according to my bill, but now why won't udemy let me continue my studies just because I'm in Russia? This action is a blatant act of stealing and appropriating property in a blatant manner. Udemy is in serious violation of consumer protection laws or frankly a SCAM (because Udemy collected my money but did NOT provide a commensurate service). A place related to education but blatantly cheating and appropriating users' assets, how does Udemy claim to be an educational tool - a civilized tool? You are behaving like a prehistoric and uncultured person. Such a tool is not qualified to teach other people how to be human. I give up Udemy forever because you are not fit for the role of imparting knowledge.PS: Who are we? We are just consumers, how can we influence the political situation of the ""big guys""? What an insult."

Udemy,2021-10-04T01:37:28.000Z,4,"Only tried the free courses, informative content. Can’t speak for anything else in relation to the company but their free content is great"
Udemy,2021-11-26T20:18:36.000Z,1,"customer service = 0. The platform is full of bugs, and they never fix the bugs reported to them because they don't care about customers only money. The videos fliker which annoys the eyes and you have to refresh the page to get rid of that every 5 minutes. This is an accessibility issue, and someone should take them to court for not being accessible and charge them bilions so that they learn a lesson that way. They are not GDPR compliance, and keep sending emails. Their GDPR guideline says click on ""unfollow post"" to not get emails, however this button does not exist, because they have changed it to ""following post"" and only this created a lot of stress for me not being able to stop them from sending me emails. In addition there is no unsubscribe button inside those emails! Someone should take them to court for non-compliance and charge them a hefty penalty. I really hope to see competitor platforms soon in the market, because I do not want to spend a penny more to support this rabbish company."
Udemy,2022-01-27T13:26:41.000Z,1,"I have been an Udemy customer for more than a decade. I bought courses and have more than 100 titles that I have archived and used for reference when needed. I got excellent support for getting some discount codes when prices were too high. My purchases were high and also refunds. Refunds were requested because the course did not meet my expectations. Udemy has an apparent and unambiguous refund policy where if you are not satisfied for any reason, a refund will be processed with no questions asked. My recent purchase from Udemy was below standard and an outdated course. I wonder why Udemy cannot vet the instructors for their content. They want to promote some of the offered courses with no quality in mind. My request for a refund has been flagged. Their support process is very cumbersome. I finally managed to speak on a chat with a rep who seemed to understand my predicament and has escalated the issue for a refund. The moral of the story: stay away from Udemy as there are other good places to get online courses."

Udemy,2022-09-12T17:22:59.000Z,1,"Udemy revoked a training course I had paid for and stated that they were unable to disclose the reasons they were forced to remove the course from their directory. Udemy sent no communication to me as an enrolled user, that this course revocation had taken place and so I was confused when I logged in to cram for my qualification exam only to find that the link in 'My Learning' for the course no longer worked. I searched the course from the main page and could see it no longer existed/appeared in their course listings. After chatting to someone on Live Chat I was informed that the course had been removed and that they would provide me refund. I complained that this would likely now impact my qualification exam as I was part way through the course they revoked and complained that they had not thought to notify enrolled users that they had revoked the course. I was offered a discount code that would ""show courses at their cheapest possible price"" (which itself goes to show the course price inflation model which Udemy work to). I rejected this as I felt it was a token gesture for the problems Udemy had just caused me and asked if it was possible to get a free course credit instead. (If I fail this qualification now, at least I can go study for another right?) but was told that Udemy had no power to issue course vouchers and that power rested solely with the course instructors. I asked what else Udemy would be able to do to remedy this situation and was presented with same copy and pasted text from earlier in the conversation, so politely left and made it clear I would write up a poor review of them and use Cybrary from here on out."

Udemy,2021-07-11T10:30:58.000Z,1,Very very unprofessional and time wasters!!!!
Udemy,2022-08-10T14:21:45.000Z,3,"On one hand, I really appreciate the vast array of courses on so many possible subjects! One can easily find some really high quality learning material on Udemy. I've learnt many things using Udemy. Standard course prices are horrendous, but I usually wait for deals and buy in bulk, since I always seem to be in the middle of another course :)That being said, I think their tech stack is... bad. Firstly, you can often see a degraded streaming performance, or their APIs sometimes take minutes to respond - which is a huge no-no for an API. It happens quite often, and the incidents are not logged by their status monitoring platform, at all. You go to status.udemy.com and everything is green, but for you - it's not working at all. So you go to DownDetector and see a large spike in reports, but Udemy Status remains green for some reason. The last time I waited about 40 minutes for the site to start responding again, and gave up after that.Next, they've added an INCREDIBLY annoying modal pop-up that's supposed to encourage you to schedule a regular learning window. Well, I didn't want to, because it didn't fit my lifestyle and personality. So I dismissed it. But it kept popping back up every few days! And there's no way to keep it disabled! I reported it, but they ""don't offer an option to dismiss this pop-up permantly"" - that's a quote from my chat with Udemy support.Broken notification settings are another thing. You have two levels of notifications: global and per individual course. So in theory you can have all notifications disabled by default, but you might want to receive info messages about promotions from a specific course you have. Well, it seems I can't turn them OFF, because I keep receiving announcements from one specific instructor. And yes, I double checked - I have all settings switched off correctly, I've even confirmed it with their support.Oh, and by the way, I when I was speaking to their support via a chat widget, the Udemy representative named Karl was extremely unhelpful. He tried dismissing me when I raised the notifications issue, ""If this still exists, please reach out to us then"", he said, like I hadn't seen it happen 5 times already.All in all, I think the idea and content you can find on there are amazing. But Udemy suffers badly from bad tech and questionable support. I think I might consider moving my learning elsewhere..."

It's absurd since there is no possibility to download this course. Dumb people if you ask me, they can't accuse without any proof.Seems that they don't care about their own customers.Stay away from them."
Udemy,2021-05-18T02:21:57.000Z,4,"I quite like Udemy. They have a huge range of courses for about £15 each, on all kinds of subjects. The course content seems to provide good value for money. I find the all-videos format difficult to engage with; but that's just my learning style, so ymmv. I'm knocking a star off because for a learning provider with such a heavy focus on video based learning, their video player really suuuuuucks. I have problems just skipping forward or back, and it absolutely refuses to buffer anything properly before playing videos; not bad if the mobile signal is good but horrible if it's not fast enough to stream properly. Overall, I am enjoying my Udemy courses though."

Udemy,2021-05-03T16:01:36.000Z,2,Their support is close to non-existent. It's very difficult to find their support email and they will respond with irrelevant links that don't work on your request. I guess once they get your payment their responsibility to the customer is done. It's a foolish policy because I have taken several classes through them and it's rather unlikely that I will ever do so again.
Udemy,2021-04-30T18:26:40.000Z,1,"The video player is terrible. It's really bad on desktop but even worse on mobile. If you want to skip the video ahead or pause it and go backwards, you have to reload the page. Autoplay seldom works. Audio is choppy even if the original video is high quality. I'll never use Udemy again"
Udemy,2021-04-28T19:50:21.000Z,2,"Stay away if you need to use Chromecast ! Which should be expected to work, as they advertise exactly that, in the App thumbnails in Google Play. But alas, futuresque black wizardry such as being able to to watch a bleedin' video on your TV, seems to be outside their current frame of ambitions. On top of that, they just say Chromecast ""may not"" be available for ""some courses"" but how the dancing jesus do they expect the customers to find that out... Should I register to udemy, buy a course, find that chromecast is completely errattic, and just go oh, thats probably one of those course that do not work and cancel the class I was about to take. Or watch it on my phone as was suggested. Support are relatively responsive and kind, and do what they can with the cut/paste utter nonsense scripts their supervisor are providing them with, but it shouldn't hurt anyone to just take a moment and read the case, and just for a second reflect on the relevance of the suggestions they forward to the customer. Pricing and discount policy does not seem to be honest or in any way balanced. I was on Udemy for a couple of months, and i believe there has been 4 or 5 ""SALES"" with heavily discounted prices. I would be absolutely furious if I was a new Udemy user that had purchased a course at full price, only to see during the coming months, that 90% sales was more the standard than an exception. It's obvious that the full prices only exist as a psycological offset to make the discounted prices look like a bargain.Technical quality also varies. Had to refund a course because the audio was overdriven and not adjusted through a long line of chapters. How can the instructor not check and notice this ? No QA from Udemy? Only upside is the education seen isolated. Some instructors are good."
Udemy,2021-04-25T09:42:07.000Z,5,"Udemy is well-structured, affordable and full of great teachers who provide great lectures about virtually any topic. As someone with a passion for self-learning I'm very happy with my Udemy experience so far."

Udemy,2021-04-20T23:10:02.000Z,2,What just happened now its really annoying. I wanted to buy a course last hour and it would not let me until the offer finished . I was trying for 1 hour and it would not let me even see the page. Still now i cant load my courses that i already have and my internet connection is really good and  other websites are fine. The courses them selves  are good ( at least the ones i have  ) but i wanted to say that because it was not fair !
Udemy,2021-04-19T12:31:16.000Z,1,"Do not buy here if you need EU VAT Reversal doneI bought these on the name of my company (also paid for by my company), requested a corrected invoice and VAT reversal, but they cannot provide this.When I asked to get the courses refunded, they say they cannot do this.

Udemy,2021-04-16T10:21:06.000Z,1,The refund policy is absolutely awful! i accidentally purchased a course and within 2 minutes i requested a refund and have not received it. Please don’t buy! you will have your money taken!!!!

Of course the special offer expired and the money is now sitting in an account unless I spent an additional £35. I am not a happy customer."
Udemy,2021-04-05T10:19:13.000Z,5,"Update: I reached out to the customer support and they were able to help, so all is good. I am literally having the same issues as the previously stated, I can't access my bought course, I never got an order confirmation email or that I've signed up, thought the money was charged. I had no issue when accessing the course on my previous computer and on the new one I can't. It looks so much like a scam at this point this learning website."

Now I'm in the same position as many others where I've purchased a course, can't access it (and it's unfinished) and Udemy support are useless. I will be recommending to my entire company and network that Udemy cannot be trusted and should be avoided. Time to get on social media and find out what others think about Udemy."

Tried several time and even reset password, but the link for the password never appear within my email. Okay, Udemy, I want my course or a refund for my order # which I have in my possession for a refund! If you have an IT employee which isn't happy with their work, perhaps they should considerate we as  consumers are paying their salaries. Plus we as consumers are making every effort to improve our livelihood from learning from others.  Hello! I do expect a refund and will contact everyone involved in this matter."

It lets me change the password but still won't let me log in.Their customer support tell you to wait 8 hours and try again. I wait 8 hours and the cycle repeats.I explained to them that due to the cyclical nature of my source IP I will be unable to use Udemy and requested a refund. Their support do their best to ignore what you are telling them and tell you to log in to request a refund, which I cannot do.Waste of time and money, archaic systems, no other online service provider has an issue with users on VPNs, they just implement 2FA and captcha.I've never felt so scammed by a service before.

Udemy website blocks me from logging in.When I ask support staff to help, they claim I can only login through the original device/browser, and that I needed to make sure I had never cleared the browser cache/cookies.When I explain that the original device is a laptop with a broken screen. They just copy and paste a response about waiting 8 hours and attempting to login from the original device.They also ignore my requests for any kind of refund.They look like a legitimate company, but essentially their website is broken (or at least severely limited) and they don't appear to have any competent tech support staff who will do anything besides copy and paste a standard response.I strongly suggest you don't fall into this trap! I feel like my money has been effectively scammed. If their site is broken they should at least offer a refund.The site is clearly set up so that you can't actually contact anyone. Their (email) support only aims to respond within 1-2 days.Avoid using this service! It might seem like it works, but only until you login, once, from a different browser. Then your account is unusable and you get stuck in this loop.I've been trying to access the courses I paid for for 2 days now.Nowhere in the process of purchasing a course does it make clear you will be locked to using from 1 device, 1 browser, and that you can't ever clear the browser cache."

Udemy,2021-02-28T18:33:42.000Z,1,I'm not sure if this is udemy or the instructor but there is no guidance on the course. No dates as for when a new lecture is added. Instructor doesn't interact with questions. The platform should at least alert the students when an instructor adds new lectures.

They then wanted me to go through my google account and prove the money had come out - I took an image of my google account and sent it to them. Now they are asking me to contact Google to ask why they didn't get both transaction IDs - now to me this is laziness on their part - they took the money, I don't have the goods but they want me to do all the work for them - what more will they ask for? I'm pretty sure they just want me to give up so they can just keep the money - Not going to happen! Really really bad customer service."

As a result, access to this account has been disabled.Thank you for your time and attention on this matter.Regards,Udemy Trust & Safety Team""No intention or process to get my account back.

Udemy,2021-02-18T13:06:33.000Z,2,"It's very instructive when a website like this advertises no contact details or facility to get in touch with anyone behind the product whatsoever. It's just a container for anyone to create a ""course"" or ""exam prep"" with zero curation or quality control. Compared to sites like code academy it's expensive as it's a per module charging model, with no consistency across each course. If you want consistent, high-quality training then look elsewhere"

Udemy,2021-02-18T11:59:10.000Z,1,This is okay but would be a lot more powerful if Udemy could pick the tutors more carefully.  A lot of tutors are using this platform as a way to do affiliate selling and so not bother to answer any questions.  Such tutors should be removed- at least for new sales.  The fact that Udemy leaves them on would suggest they don't really care and this reduces their own credibility.  Just downgraded my rating after realising that my bad review of a course does not appear on the default review page which is meant to be by date.  This appears to be intentionally misleading and further reduces trust in this company
Udemy,2021-02-09T10:16:28.000Z,5,I have purchased the Affinity Master Photography Course and also Basic Affinity Course and now I cannot access either.  I have sent messages and got no response whatsoever.

Udemy,2021-02-03T17:40:37.000Z,4,"I've followed a few IT courses of which I am extremely satisfied. In a couple of weeks I have gained skills that would have taken me months to gain on the field.The courses are also often on sale, so if you can wait you can get superb return for your bucks.There are a few down sides also. Not all course contents or teachers are perfect. Those courses can be dodged by investing some time with search filters  and by reading the reviews. Also few courses are interactive, so following up with practice is up to the student.I wholeheartedly recommend it, but - as with all things - use it wisely."
Udemy,2021-02-02T05:29:11.000Z,4,"They're not perfect, but they're pretty good. Different instructors have different styles of teaching. I've completed 30 hours of nutrition courses and am taking a beginning chemistry course which will add another 30 hours to my coursework. Some professors give tests but most don't. It's more than just videos most have downloadable pdf resources. When you finish a class there's a trophy looking thing that says ""get certificate"" it ask if you want to download as an jpg or pdf.I have bought 18 courses and I am having trouble with some of them. My Spanish skills are not that good but I am attempting to learn, same with chemistry and algebra. But that's more on me than them. Most the nutrition are taught either by doctors or Registered Dietitians.I don't think the certificates are transferable for college credit, but some of my classes were internationally accredited and the instructor will give you instructions on how to get that diploma which involves taking a screenshot of your completed course. I do think the information is useful though. Some of the classes are college level and will prepare for a college. I think, in a way, they are more economical than Alison. At Alison the classes are free but you have to pay for your certificate. And who knows if it will ever get to you by mail. My biggest problems with Udemy are 1) I'm running out of room on my computer to download the many wonderful resources and 2) I'm running out of ink in my printer. There is one class where I couldn't get the test to move on. I checked to make sure my answer was marked. It didn't tell me if my answer was right or wrong, and wouldn't let me move on to the next question.They also give you the option of rating each class. So if you think a class is boring you can say so in your review of the class."
Udemy,2021-01-29T09:12:30.000Z,1,This course provider is not to be trusted. They offer a certificate at the end of their courses if you complete the course and pass your tutor assessment. This is false as I recently paid to take one of their courses and I passed it with flying colours only to be told that a certificate cannot be given. I will not be taking any more of their courses because of this and I will be spreading the word that Udemy are not to be trusted.

Udemy,2021-01-20T10:49:27.000Z,1,"Just had my first experience with Udemy. The course does not in any way deliver on all the subjects mentioned in the description, and the speaker has the most horrible accent making it almost impossible to understand his english. Apparently there is no quality checking by Udemy at all. It would have been very easy to discover that this course does not deliver, since there is only 7 small lections for a subject that require much much more. For someone new to Udemy it leaves the impression that it's a big scam.I have requested a refund."
Udemy,2021-01-19T10:36:28.000Z,4,"If you choose your courses wisely then this is a great platform, I've been in the process of a career change in to the tech industry and the courses I've taken on Udemy have been a great help. I don't like the way they set the prices up though. Obviously nobody buys them at full price, if there isn't a sale on then there's always a voucher code to get the course cheap. I don't see why Udemy doesn't just sell the courses at the lower cost all the time, I totally get why people see them as a potential scam because of the the way the prices change all the time. As for the people saying the courses are terrible, do your research before taking a course and you'll find the right one. Had to contact technical support once because I purchased the wrong course. Had a full refund within 24 hours."

Udemy,2021-01-16T16:04:10.000Z,5,"I dont understand why there are so many bad reviews for Udemy.Probably, because people are not smart enough who don't know how to use/utilise the platform.I have been using the platform for 2 years now.1st point) No it is not a scam. There is lot of content and you can learn lot of videos which are great.2nd point) Yes, its very easy to get refund. All you have to do is press, right click on the top menu when you are on the course and click on ""Request Refund"" and fill the form and money comes to your account. The money came to my account. There was no problem. 3rd point) Those people that say they only refund credits, well they are not that clever are they, went you request the money, they give you two options .request credit or refund (its right below request credits option).4th point) ait is not expensive if you know how the model of Udemy works.  Every few days they bring down the prices (I know they say discount ends soon, but its just marketing tacktic). You just have to search it everyday and you will find discounted price atlesst 5 days every 2 weeks."

That's why I took the course and felt like I was being fooled, not fair practices here. Second, I didn't learn anything really and then when I asked a question to the authors about why the category of the Professional Life Coach doesn't even exist when you try to fill a profile on their site or to get a certificate they never even bothered answering so can't really do anything with that certificate. So I asked a refund but it was refused."

Udemy,2021-01-06T20:55:52.000Z,4,I appreciate what you are doing for the community. I think your platform is very versatile and a lot of good knowledge can be learned through it.

Udemy,2021-01-04T21:36:48.000Z,5,I've tried most of the online learning companies that provide IT courses and I find Udemy to be the best. There's almost always a sale so you can expect to pay about £13 for life time access to each course. There is a fair amount of rubbish on there but an awful lot of awesome content too. I've had a few really bad courses that I've requested (and been given) a refund for. By far and away the best value training and once you find some instructors you trust and gel with it's fantastic. The website and apps for android and ios are just fine and you get a certificate of completion for LinkedIn as well. I genuinely think if you're prepared to put in the effort you'll get every bit as much out of some course here as you would from companies selling live taught courses at 100 times the price you'll pay on Udemy.
Udemy,2021-01-01T22:32:13.000Z,1,"Udemy is a scam! They steal your money and when the program does not work, they claim its on your side even if you did everything they asked you to do and the course will still not work, they will claim it works on their side, I don't believe they ever check.  You can go on youtube and learn for free instead of giving money to these scammers."
Udemy,2021-01-01T16:31:01.000Z,3,"I like the content that I've bought but Udemy have misleading campaigns. They claim that the courses normally cost like $100-140, but they have a 90-95 % off ""only today"". The thing is, only today seems to be 360 out of 365 days. I'm not really sure that's legal in my country, but I guess they've got that stuff taken care of somehow.And in one course, the teacher said that ""learn this skill for the price of a fancy coffee"". For $129, it has to be a really fancy coffee... (or the course was obviosuly never intended to cost $129)."
Udemy,2020-12-28T19:29:57.000Z,1,"they refused to give me refund even though I was in the 30 day refund period.scam website, keep away"

Udemy,2021-01-01T10:19:53.000Z,1,"UDEMY IS BLOCKING ME FROM SEEING MY 20 PLUS COURSES. i never had trouble to link/login..all of a sudden i had nothing but problems to access my courses that i paid for during the years...Can you imagine for at least 1 month  I was not able to login/access my account!!!! I gave up now and I have called my lawyers, this is utterly stupid and unbusinesslike and robbery.1- I spent time with at least a dozen emails re: merged account.2- after this I continued to have problems with my login details, they would forget my passwords ....then they would not allow me to reset the password...since no emails were sent for the reset?!!3- IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND AN EMAIL TO CONTACT THEM THAT WORKS ..PLUS WHEN YOU TRY TO EMAIL ON THEIR SITE ...IT LINKS SOMEWHERE ELSEWHERE on their fill in (no email tracking is possible etc) and or  YOU NEED TO BE LOGGED IN??  THIS IS MANIPULATIVE CRAP. WHEN THERE THEY PRETEND THERE IS AN EMAIL..IT SENDS YOU TO FILL OUT A FORM ON THEIR SITE.  And i have paid courses on their site? Makes no sense.This is so stupid and abusive considering 20 courses were paid ...so i started asking for a refund for most recent courses and also ASKED FOR A TOTAL REFUND OF ALL MY COURSES WHICH PROBABLY IS ABOUT 600.00 US currencyTHIS COMPANY IS VERY STUPID OR THEY ARE THEIVES. Since i have even tried too to communicate with an old email re: i was having too many problems and 2- wanted a refund 3- also told them i would call cops...BUT NOTHING HAPPENED?! I HAVE TROUBLE TRUSTING THIS BUSINESS MODEL NOW. I will not invest on services where I cannot hold the product myself in my computer.  I say Udemy fu.  This has been a very disruptive unjustifed lockdown of my account on my dime.---After I reviewed here and asked for help on Quora, Quora all of a sudden remembers how to reset passwords?  So now after a month or so i can access my account, but it's too late this business model is outdated and soul less."
Udemy,2020-12-17T00:30:58.000Z,2,"The courses are affordable due to never ending discounts and sales. However once purchased, good luck watching them online interruption free. I could not stream any courses at speeds greater than 80KB/s in Australia on a 250/100Mb fibre connection. I need to use 3rd party tools to watch the course videos as a result. This is very poor form from a company selling training videos ONLINE. If Udemy improve their streaming capabilities I will happily return as a paying customer. Until then I am sourcing my training elsewhere."
Udemy,2020-12-14T16:32:47.000Z,4,Great way to learn new technologies and gain new skills during pandemic. Flexible refund policy and amazing selection of courses helps Udemy to stand out.
Udemy,2020-12-12T20:41:52.000Z,5,I was gifted a bookkeeping course by my father and I have to say I learned a lot. They had this massive sale and I took that opportunity to learn a new skill. It actually lead me to study accounting in college. The lessons are explained nicely and the teacher in the video was very professional and educated. I would definitely buy another course because the more skills the better.

Udemy,2020-12-04T13:48:35.000Z,3,"The courses are often stand alone, which affects the quality and the value one can get from them. I have taken about 5 course on Udemy and only one graphics design course stood out."

Udemy,2020-11-30T12:19:16.000Z,3,"Normal prices are silly. But with 80% off, I thought the course was a useful supplement to learning - though it's not a stand alone course.They need a proof reader: lots of minor mistakes e.g. copo is glass not cup."

Udemy,2020-11-29T13:04:44.000Z,5,"I've been using Udemy for a number of years now for courses mainly on software development.The important thing when using them is to wait for their sales which are very regular, and to read reviews on the courses you want to take. If you do take a chance on a course that has few reviews, you can always use the 30 day money back guarantee which they have honoured in the few times I've used it.The longer courses tend to be the better ones and they offer good value as you can purchase them for between £10 and £15 depending on the current offers."
Udemy,2020-11-28T19:31:52.000Z,1,"Though I love to be able to purchase courses that help me with my current project, there are constant problems with my video quality.  When I email support they tell me it's on my end, my software, my device, but I have multiple devices and the problems remain. Annoyingly they always show these pop ups asking you to rate the course at the very beginning of the course... what's the point of that?  And if you review early, you can't alter your review at the end."
Udemy,2020-11-28T12:47:51.000Z,2,All the learning programs are not good however some are very good. The refund policy seems to work however if you close an account they hold on to your information. I had 2 account learning different topics. As above not very good however the other account has a good tutor. Having closed the account I am unable to use my main e mail address as they are storing this data

Udemy,2020-11-23T22:32:36.000Z,4,"I have taken a number of courses on udemy. though not all of them have been great, some has been exceptional. The secret is to read through the review of each course before enrolling in it."
Udemy,2020-11-21T00:49:02.000Z,5,I'll keep this short and simple. Udemy is a great place to learn if you're looking for experienced educators.
Udemy,2020-11-20T12:30:32.000Z,4,"I have done so many numerous courses with Udemy, after using years of their service I found certain things they could do to improve their system.One is a badge that shows a course is outdated especially with IT related stuff.  Second if you could transfer a course you purchased and have never used it to another person.Without this feature I won't give them 5 stars."
Udemy,2020-11-20T09:17:41.000Z,5,"The best site for online courses. I have bought 5 courses on this site, 10 dollars each. It is an amazing and great site."
Udemy,2020-11-19T12:37:04.000Z,4,"Udemy courses are often overpriced. I would never pay full price for any of them. They do however go on sale fairly often, and you can get them for around $10. Some of the best $10 I ever spent were on this site. Great UI too!"
Udemy,2020-11-18T06:35:02.000Z,4,Nice website.Udemy is an amazing website. I learned some courses just free of cost.
Udemy,2020-11-17T22:15:59.000Z,4,"You have to check the reviews of the course you are interest in first, just in case because there's so many options. Easy lessons at your own pace. I did the Online Japanese N5 Course (All 15 lessons) by Attain Corp. for £12.99, they were doing a good discount at the time and I thought why not? I think online courses requires you to have the self-motivation and independence to learn by yourself. But I do prefer classroom settings because I find it much more interactive and fun, but of course because of the pandemic a lot of places shut down their classroom language courses and moved to online but the prices remain high. So this was a bargain. Good thing is, even after completing the course the videos and contents are still available on my account so I can still keep checking back. Although there is an active Q+A section where you can type a question and someone from the course will reply. I still feel it's sort of lacking without a tutor to correct you verbally."
Udemy,2020-11-15T23:13:04.000Z,5,Works great offline so i study at work in a forklift. I have a few courses  3 on hold and 3 completed.
Udemy,2020-11-13T13:03:40.000Z,5,Great content for learning. I have already done 3 courses and intend to do more. Some great lecturers on it! Highly recommended
Udemy,2020-11-09T21:46:30.000Z,3,Before you buy your course check the reviews especially the ones that give a low star rating because you will find information like if the Course is out dated. Which I have found a lot. Some of them are from way back in 2016 and are so out of date. Look for teaches and coaches that update their course informaiton every year.
Udemy,2020-11-08T14:37:09.000Z,5,Great courses for a good price and their refund policy is awesome!
Udemy,2020-11-07T17:58:52.000Z,5,"What I like most about Udemy, they stop greedy instructors who put crazy amount of money for their courses. Their policy about lifetime access and can't be found on any other platform.I wish I knew about Udemy before I have done my Master degree and paid that crazy amount of money."
Udemy,2020-11-04T14:48:17.000Z,4,I really enjoyed the courses I undertook on Udemy. There's quite a diverse range to pick from and due to the site's discounts and offers they are usually at quite an affordable price too!

Udemy,2020-10-24T10:05:26.000Z,1,"Most unreliable - Udemy started as the most comprehensive and reliable platform for learning and upgrading skills, but eventually it has become more of a money making business which will not hesitate to deceive there customers to make money from dodgy instructors who will publish courses udemy make there subscription money and then deny services before running away. I had my exams booked and bought a practise test for mock exams, to my surprise I was not able to access it just a week before my actual exam, I asked udemy for help and they said they can't help me as its not uncommon for the instructors on the site to remove a course outside of our user agreement policies. shocking.. personally you are better off with more reliable learning services such as CloudGuru and Linux Academy."

Only worse.This company claims to offer a money-back guarantee FOR ANY REASON, but they didn’t honor mine and they have denied hundred of people, as you have already probably found out, but the biggest red flag is how Udemy has a 9.1 rating on Bit Degree and only a  2.7 average review on Trust Pilot. What’s worse, is their even more abysmal rating of 2.0 on Consumer Affairs."
Udemy,2020-10-19T19:10:03.000Z,3,"Udemy has some fine courses for sure, used a few and learned a lot on designing, drawing and using CC programs. The pricing how ever.. They artificially inflate their prices, they try to get you to act on impulse. ''Oh this course is only 9,99 for 2 more hours?! better buy it now before it's up to $199 again!'' Urgenty marketing.. Just refresh your cookies or use incognito, and you will see the ''sale prices'' yet again. Overall there are some amazing courses, just dont get pulled into their marketing scheme, on Udemy, it's always sale."

Udemy,2020-10-15T19:41:09.000Z,1,Udemy is a joke for Instructors. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. Just too much to write. Trust me Instructors: learn the skills and publish your knowledge yourself!For students: ok.
Udemy,2020-10-07T04:25:18.000Z,4,"Overall: cost performance is very good.Get the courses while on sale :). I have tried a couple of courses and the quality really depends on:- The type of course- Your understanding / skills about the topic- The lecturer and his/her backgroundUdemy has many awesome sales so you can get your favorite subjects for less than $15 or so. I learned a lot from their copywriting course, creative course, marketing course and UI/UX design course. There might have been 1 course where I thought I'd learn a bit more than was taught, but to me, even if I learn 1 new valuable skill I can implement in my life, it's definitely worth the money."
Udemy,2020-09-28T18:39:23.000Z,1,"I have used it for a few years but recently it is getting worst. They change the refund policy without notice. it is not about 30 days refund, if you refund same classes over one time, you cant. And you have to return exactly 30days(24hrs*30). you wont get refund if you one minute late. You tried to contact the support, but chat only send the link what you can lookup online and they never get you back from email...finally, you got a credit refund with a expired date...All they want is $$"

Udemy,2020-09-21T22:25:05.000Z,1,"Never ever use these people. I created an account and paid £50 for a course. A week later they disabled my account telling me I had violated the terms and conditions. I hadn’t even done the course. I asked for a refund, they refused and still wouldn’t tell me what I had violated. I have kept every mail and responded to everything they asked for. I cannot believe an organisation can get away with this behaviour. Don’t use them. There are better online providers you can use."
Udemy,2020-09-20T19:09:03.000Z,3,I have used Udemy for a while now. It has some good courses and some not so good. I have to say i like the concept and platform. When you find a gem you really find a gem.
Udemy,2020-09-12T10:26:26.000Z,4,Great courses-I especially love Angela Yu's lessons. It would be better if the weight of the course is considered for the price though.

Udemy,2020-08-31T14:31:40.000Z,1,"I recently signed up for a full stack development course and a 30-day refund was highlighted at sign-up in case of any change in mind. After doing about 10% of the course, I realized that the latter 90% of the course is missing some components so I would rather do another course which offered these components.So I reached out to customer service asking for a refund or an offset credit against the other course and was pointed to a refund policy which says that refund may not be allowed if a ""significant chunk of the course has been consumed""So I asked the customer support whether 10% classifies as a significant chunk and the answer was yes!There is lack of transparency about the refund policy at the time of marketing these courses on the site ans stuff like this should be highlighted properly. This is without even going into how 10% can be classified as a significant chunk of a course."

Having successfully produced and published my course a week before the deadline (and accepted by Udemy), there was no reward to be seen. Having reached out to them to see what was going on, they were unwilling to keep to their side of the bargain. It’s very disappointing and I certainly feel cheated. I won’t be pursuing with more courses on Udemy as this is not a company I want to profit out of my hard work. A review I wish I never had to write..."

I emailed, they were no help.People keep calling it a scam, and I'd be inclined to agree.In 2 years I had 35 natural sales, that should have been £1225 - a % cut for them - I took £180.I sold the same course in one of my own online stores and made over £3K !!!!! Bit of a difference huh??Don't waste your time with these pirates."
Udemy,2020-08-14T21:11:54.000Z,1,"if I could, I would give no star. It's such a scam. Yesterday I just came to this website and the price was 13.99 $. I wanted to buy 14 courses, but my credit card didn't work. I tried a few times, did everything right, but I guess, they wanted to sell the courses for this price. The support also didn't respond which told me, I was right. In this case, I think, to book a month fxphd is cheaper and you have more options for courses."

Don't pay more as 9.99 for one course or you will be tricked, they're to hungry to play fair games with you and they want just your money."
Udemy,2020-07-24T14:55:11.000Z,1,"Found some good courses at a discoutn but what I find strange is that their courses seem like they are perpetually on discount. Also, sometimes when access the same course using different browsers in private / incognito mode, I get different prices for the SAME COURSE. The difference can be VAST. There was a course that when viewed normally cost $199. But when I logged into check it via Chrome in incognito mode, the price was a mere $19.99. That's a difference of >$150.... I think there should be more transparent pricing here...."
Udemy,2020-07-23T08:39:50.000Z,1,Recently paid to take the negotiation course which I thought was very poor. They pretty much stated the obvious and the presenter looked uncomfortable in front of the camera. I looked elsewhere and found a course by 'quicked courses' that was free and actually better than the paid one by Udemy!!! I doubt I will be using Udemy again. Great website/platform but the course quality is just not good enough especially with other companies giving free online courses
Udemy,2020-07-22T09:49:05.000Z,5,I have completed over a dozen courses from economics to software development. They have all been very good; some have been exceptional. Material was reall good especially java script examples are very useful. Thank you!
Udemy,2020-07-21T14:38:54.000Z,1,"Pretty much what you would expect from a facebook ad. To say Udemy are manipulative with their pricing is an understatement. 21st century con artists.Secondly, they decline any sign up details aside from those initiated through social media. Now I do not know if this is intentional but the same issue occurred on multiple devices, and with the vibes they give out I wouldn't put it past them.If you are on the fence don't do it."
Udemy,2020-07-18T15:42:11.000Z,4,Everything was great except for the fact that their pricing is not transparent. They're always having a 95% off which is a little bit confusing

I left them in my cart and when I came back they were still the same price. But then i closed the screen, 1 minute later reopened another tab and both courses had gone up to £13.99 each. I went to my other browser and they were advertised for £11.99, shady Udemy. I was a fan but you lost your integrity for £2.00 a course.

Udemy make an agreement with trainers for monthly payments. I am working with Udemy since April and according to the agreement my first payment had to be done 5th of June. But I got nothing. I wrote several times to Udemy about my payment but they did not try to solve the problem and sent me to Payoneer which is Udemy’s payment platform. Today is 17th of July. I am still waiting my money. It is a shame.
Udemy,2020-07-03T19:18:22.000Z,2,The courses are very good but pricing practices are terribly shady and they penalise existing customers for their custom.

After it being in my Wishlist I was informed that it was on special offer with 94% off but when I went to check the list price had changed to £199.99 - for a 3 hour course! Their pricing structure means absolutely nothing. If I am not logged in to my Udemy account I see £199.99 courses for £34.99. When I contacted Udemy to ask what was going on I was told that they run promotions - however if they just make up prices then promotions are of little consequence. Whatever you do do not put stuff on your Wishlist and think twice about giving them repeat custom - they obviously don't reward it with anything but an expectation that they can fleece you.
Udemy,2020-07-03T13:53:05.000Z,5,"During the Covid-19 situation, I have purchased several Udemy courses and have found them to be incredibly educational and valuable. They offer a vast amount of content, so it can be hard to find what is right for you but the course previews are really helpful to enable you to check the course you are looking at is right for you, before you purchase it.A great online resource."
Udemy,2020-06-30T23:27:21.000Z,1,"I was offered a free trial for a graphic design course, I signed up but soon realised that I was too busy to be able to complete it, I thought I had cancelled my account until today when £49.99 had been withdrawn from my bank. I contacted udemy who replied saying they would not refund me, I tried phoning them to just be given automated responses. Awful customer service and I will definitely never ever recommend. Do not use Udemy as it’s a scam and many others along side myself have fallen victim to this company."
Udemy,2020-06-28T12:16:51.000Z,2,"Some of the courses are excellent value for money, but you have to be very careful as some are incredibly basic. As an example, I took a course that claimed to be a ""complete"" web development course. The reality is that it was a somewhat decent introductory course, but was missing so much that to claim to be ""complete"" is grossly overstating things. Nothing at all on front or back end frameworks, nothing on build tools, no mention even of version control! That said, when the courses cost in the region of £10 - 15, even the basic ones are not too bad for complete beginners. My biggest gripe with the platform however is the pricing. On occasion I see courses in the range of £10 - 15, only to then see the price go up to £199.99 once I've signed into my account, ready to buy the course. Typically, if you wait, there'll be a period during which the price will come down, and you may be able to get the course for around £10 - 20. But I find this is an incredibly poor way to treat longstanding customers and because of this I cannot recommend the platform."
Udemy,2020-06-27T12:41:12.000Z,5,Lots of lockdown discounts on great courses. Signed up to a few and really gaining a lot. Can’t fault it.
Udemy,2020-07-01T03:53:10.000Z,5,Decent platform to learn fundamentals in programming languages but only when they have discounts
Udemy,2020-06-21T18:06:40.000Z,1,"Worse course you could do, specially in coding or data science. Youtube tutorials has been flooded with adds from this company trying to lure people into their courses. Don't be fooled."
Udemy,2020-06-18T15:32:01.000Z,4,"So, hm. Yeah, of course there are some junk courses on Udemy. But all and all it's been a complete blessing. I've spent over $2,000 over the last 10 years on $10 Udemy courses. That's less than the cost on a single college class at RIT, which luckily the Army paid for :)In MBA school they didn't teach us the important stuff to run a business. Stuff like Linux, LLC formation, profit and loss statements, risk evaluations, taxes, investment or intellectual property.All that I learned on Udemy. Pick your courses well, anyways you can refund junk ones, and go to town. $10 is nothing to learn some of the crazy helpful things I've learned on their platform. Highly recommended. Pro tip: Check out Chris Haroun. That guys is a God send."
Udemy,2020-06-12T15:19:32.000Z,5,I am learning new things in this lockdown period. Thanks to udemy for making it easy.
Udemy,2020-06-12T10:37:47.000Z,1,"I subscribed to Udemy Master Photography Course, the course was discounted from $199 to around $18, I was also prompted to subscribed to the night photo course for just £10 more, for a total of around £24 (GBP). Paid with my credit card and started the course. After 4 weeks, I couldn't access the course, thought it was strange so reached out to Udemy CS and they told me that my payment was blocked, i checked withe bank and credit card company but the payment was made and received by Udemy on the day of payment 4 weeks ago. I complained to Udemy but they ask to prove that payment was made, so i went back to my bank to find out that Udemy was trying to claim monthly payments through a recurring payment request which the bank did block.  The course was paid in full, all be it discounted, up front and hence Udemy shouldn't require any additional payment. Beware. Check your credit card payments."
Udemy,2020-06-08T12:12:02.000Z,1,When you purchase a course with Udemy you are supposed to have LIFETIME access.  I have purchased material that I knew I would need i the future and now the course is no longer available for me to use although they have a similar course on the same subject but will not give me access to that.  I will not purchase courses in the future with this company because of this and will look to seek alternative training providers.
Udemy,2020-06-07T01:32:43.000Z,3,"from my own experience some courses are very interesting, however support just takes months to answer you, sometimes it doesn't at all.."
Udemy,2020-06-05T07:22:06.000Z,1,My account is banned and I have tried several times to talk to the support team for resolution but I got nothing in terms of response.
Udemy,2021-01-07T23:59:30.000Z,1,They sell courses without clarifying that the teachers are not scammers. So i bought a bunch of jason allen courses and they are full of false promises. I want my money back because I bought a course that doesn exist. Udemy dont answer my messages through udemy website support for WEEKS. I just want my money and dont be scammed again. ..
Udemy,2020-05-30T12:46:48.000Z,1,"My account just got banned on Udemy, guess why? I was trying to publish a course on their platform and during the verification process, I asked the support if they have any other verification method other than the one provided they responded back with a ban on my account + I can't even access the courses I bought and they said it's their final decision because the employer apparently didn't like that I am asking for another verification method her name is Carolina H what a silly person she is."
Udemy,2020-05-27T17:33:33.000Z,5,"OKAY THIS IS TRULY SHOCKING!As someone already wrote down here, how on earth there are negative reviews? I may tell you why... but first my review!I cannot thank Udemy enough for the excellent platform, and probably for the reason why I can keep my job in this current crisis having learnt fundamental skills to make me more essential for my company a very competitive prices, as they can count on total revenue with high volume and I assume some form of reward to tutors based on popularity. The platform is excellent, only one downside is FIX YOUR DOWNLOAD AS EVERYTHING IS CALL ORIGINAL FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS!!! Here we go that is my downside for this platform.Courses are various and it is up to you to read the reviews and ensure it fits your need, I had to refund two courses as they were not exactly what I was looking for, one I was 80% through it and they refunded it no question asked, on 20 courses I refunded only two.Now for the dumb down here talking about OFFICIAL ACCREDITATION, this is a private learning platform, common sense dictate that they are not official as such but you can prepare for any official accreditation, if needed, eventually on the job market what matter is what you can do and what's on your CV anyway.Also certain things are relevant for each course only, such as response time from a tutor, so far I got all courses where tutor replied in more than excellent time (hours not days) and what I learned in the subject I am following is priceless, i.e. a 3D course in London for a week is £900 (from) I got to a mid level user here for 1/100th less, same with coding.Prices: They are always on sale, consider the sale price as normal however really some courses are worth the asking price not on sale, it is incredible how they can achieve so low prices ensuring tutor Q&A Support for like a ridiculously dirty cheap price, we can just thank them to make everyone happy here, tutors and users.Support so far has been helpful, except done for this two months lasting bug with the downloads naming. They are quick even during the pandemic, for refunds most of the time you don't need to speak to no one.Video Quality: That's up to the tutors often, if they record 720p they record 720p, not much can be done... however all courses I have had are 1080p which is plenty for computer related courses.Really this platform is a god send for anyone wishing to improve him/herself, one thing, when you take a course you pay for the course not to harass a tutor in the Q&A about your own bloody specific needs for your project, it  is not a consultancy firm, is a TRAINING, you learn you apply and you ask question related to the course, not your own job!!! That is really irritating as Q&A are full of not relevant cluttery questions on some courses."
Udemy,2020-05-27T14:10:43.000Z,1,I bought a course and halfway through the sound stopped working. You can follow the subtitle but otherwise completely useless. What a waste!!I contacted their customer service more than a dozen times and I am still waiting to hear from them. This is extremely poor customer and technical service! Never again!
Udemy,2020-05-24T17:12:58.000Z,1,They offer career coaching courses. They are not an accredited route to becoming a Careers Practitioner in a school or college in the UK. Search the National Careers Service website for trusted advice on how to become a Careers Practitioner
Udemy,2020-05-21T10:39:49.000Z,5,I am very happy with Udemy. There are so many high-quality IT courses which will help you with your job or university. Obviously don't buy them when they are for like 100 pounds or more just wait for sales.Jakub
Udemy,2020-05-18T19:59:50.000Z,2,"Video lessons keep pausing. Takes roughly an hour to watch a 20min lesson. It seems I’m not the only One having the problem on a Pilates course. Very difficult getting the problem resolved, I’m still working on it 4 weeks after purchasing the course."
Udemy,2020-05-17T09:59:00.000Z,1,"I’ve bought a number of courses on Udemy and overall, they have met my expectations, with a few exceptions. However, my negative review is about Udemy’s business practices, which in my view exploit existing loyal users by inflating prices. I’ll use the latest example of a stock trading course, which I’ve just purchased. When I googled the course, I found it advertised on Udemy for £13.99, which I thought was a very good price. This type of price is usually available when they have sales on, so I was happy to purchase the course. I followed the link and logged into my Udemy’s account, only to find out that the price had now jumped to £199 pounds with no explanation about the price difference. There was no reference to the fact that the cheaper price might only be available to new users or anything like that. I was just presented with the higher price and expected to complete the transaction, which I didn’t. At this point, I log out of my account and run the search again, but the price displayed is still £ 199 pounds. I thought that it could be because of cookies downloaded when I was browsing the Udemy’s site but clearing the browser cache didn’t fix the issue. I then tried to run the search from another computer, only to be presented again with the high price of £ 199 pounds. It then occurred to me that the Udemy’s system might now be using my home IP address to block me from seeing the cheaper prices on offer, regardless of what computer I was using.  At that point, I cleared the browser cache, connected to a VPN service, which changed my public IP address and run the search again. Guess what? The course was priced again at £13.99. I then just opened a new account in Udemy and purchased the course at the advertised price of £ 13.99. Are these the business practices one would expect from a company that wants to build a loyal user base??"
Udemy,2020-05-15T12:59:49.000Z,4,The prices are quite reasonable and I definitely recommend.

""Integral training in Fusion 360"" lasts an hour and covers only 1/1000 of the software, we learn to do the sketches and that's all 99% of the course is missing"
Udemy,2020-05-11T15:48:57.000Z,5,"Thoroughly enjoyed my course on Metacognition, excellent pace,  loads of resources given and now I able to use this with my students. Thank you"
Udemy,2020-05-10T23:58:16.000Z,5,"I'm surprised by the overall negative reviews, but after reading many individual ones, it seems some people either 1) Didn't take the time to learn or understand the platform, the return policy, etc, 2) Seem to expect a formal college type class for $10-$15, or 3) Were unhappy with a course and instead of rate the course in Udemy, they decided to blame Udemy as a whole. Udemy simply provides the platform for everyday people to house and sell their courses. Keeping in mind that we're often learning from average people with the skills or knowledge we want, I'm extremely happy with the Udemy platform. They often have sales, where we can get courses for $10-$15. (As long as the content creators participate in the sales. Those who don't usually get far less sales, so boo on them.) Keeping that in mind, the courses often exceed my expectations, and I feel I get more value than what I pay. That said, I would not buy courses that aren't on sale because they have sales at least once a month. I've gotten a couple of crap courses before, and like most others do, I give honest feedback and request a refund within the 30 day money back guarantee. Then I pay nothing for the crappy course, and the instructor doesn't get my money, pretty simple. Those who obviously rush to put crap on Udemy for a quick buck, they get run off pretty quickly, either from Udemy or due to a ruined reputation. Thanks to the consumers who leave negative reviews on the courses themselves. After all, it's the low quality instructors who deserve the bad rap, not Udemy. If you want a formal education or to be taught by licensed teachers, there's Coursera and many online college campuses. For several thousand dollars, you can get exactly what you're looking for! As for me, I'm happy to learn exactly what I want to learn at the moment, get in and get out for about $13. I've been a regular Udemy consumer for about 4 years now, and I own over a hundred courses. What's nice is you can easily discover who the high quality teachers are and which ones often update their courses. After all, once you purchase a course, you get lifetime access. This is especially important when purchasing something tech related. It makes it nice to pop in a course I've owned for 3 years and get updated content to refresh with. I own many courses because I've found much more quality than crap overall and highly recommend Udemy for those who understand what it's all about."
Udemy,2020-05-07T18:02:25.000Z,5,"You won’t get the same level of education from a University degree but for the price you shouldn’t expect that. For the £13.99 price I’ve paid for the courses I’ve taken they have been great value for money. I wouldn’t say the courses are worth much more than that price though, so probably wouldn’t pay “full” price for any of them."
Udemy,2020-05-06T15:40:07.000Z,4,It is a good tool when you start learning programming. Unfortunatelly after you get to certain level of knowledge it comes time you need to start working with real people.
Udemy,2020-05-02T04:31:01.000Z,1,"The unbelievable drama just to get on as they don't allow us to choose our own passwords.  Then I had the same issue as others have mentioned where the course was $14.99, but when I realised that I had signed up years ago and logged in with my original account it gave me an error message when I went to checkout. Low & behold even though it stated the 'startlearningnow' coupon had been applied the cost was now $209.  If I wasn't paying attention I would have paid $209 instead of the $14.99.  Completely unethical!!!!!"
Udemy,2020-05-01T18:31:33.000Z,1,"Total waste of money..I purchased 2 courses for CPD that I require. I watched the video then  worked through the course work completing questions at the end of each module. Checked my email da da ..there was my diploma!!!! I hadn't even submitted the last  'marked assignment' that I had spent time working on. I decided to take a look at the 2nd course, downloaded the PDF course manual then watched the video... there it was, another certificate of completion with no work submitted. What I am really angry about is that I spent a considerable amount of time of the first course completing the tasks and questions and the certificate only shows the time spent watching the video. So it looks like I only have 32 minutes for my CPD when I have worked a lot longer than that. I can read the PDF course work and gain information but my job requires hours of CPD which these courses don't give, even if you do the work.It is  worrying that I now have a 'diploma' in couples counselling, from this provider, yet I haven't done any work..."
Udemy,2020-04-30T12:56:14.000Z,5,I have accessed a number of free courses using Udemy and they have been great so far. Granted I probably wouldn't have paid for them as they are little more than a YouTube video and some notes but they have good content considering it's free. Great to keep me busy and up skill whilst off work due to Coronavirus.
Udemy,2020-04-29T13:43:38.000Z,4,"Personally very happy with many of my courses.Wouldnt pay full price, abut at £10-15, really great value for money.They even let me merge two of my accounts together to consolidate my library.Allowed me to return a course whenever I have needed it.A few dud courses (which is why this is a 4, not a 5), but you can always return a course if you do so in a timely manner."
Udemy,2020-04-28T21:32:29.000Z,1,"I signed up with the offer that my first course would cost me £13.99. When I went to check out for the course I was interested in at the last second I was nearly charged the full £100 for the course. If I hadn't noticed in my paypal screen whilst checking out I would've paid the full price. In my eyes this reeks of banditry and is not good business practice... I would recommend strongly considering working with people who will try and pull this on new customers, let alone long term ones."

Udemy,2020-06-01T05:52:48.000Z,3,"My wife recently purchased a few Udemy courses for my birthday.  I so wish I'd checked this out much sooner!  All this time wasted.The 2.7 rating on here is very harsh, but you only have to scroll back a few reviews and see people complain about the course content they signed up for.  Feed that back on the course itself within Udemy.  Thats not the fault of Udemy.  The reviews within udemy are useful to get peoples feelings before you enroll or not.Edit: I have just contradicted myself and knocked this 5* review down to 3* because of the inconsistency in the pricing.  The course 'The Complete Web Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery' is currently showing as being £13.99 in the app with a 67% discount from £44.99.  Now if I look at the exact same course on the website, it is listed as £16.99 with a 92% discount from £199.99.  Same course, same log in details, different price.  So before i purchase any courses, I have to check the website AND the app for the best price."

Alas, on login for the start, the Udemy site tells me I am signed up for ""Beginners NIKON...DSLR.."" and not CANON!I immediately contacted Udemy and explained my predicament and suggested they either swap the course over for me to the one I originally selected or give me a refund and I can then start again with the course I had intended. There is a limit of 3 days before this offer expires! Three days later and nothing from Udemy. Would you believe it?  Udemy do a cart load of courses teaching all you need to know about good customer service. Great to hear from you Udemy!"

Udemy,2020-04-13T11:54:02.000Z,5,"Of course, you have to get used first with their promotional model. And NEVER pay for a course, unless it is in promotion, at just $10-$15 US dollars. And they usually have such a window every few days. If not, just create a new user account, from another email...I passed several AWS certifications just in the last month with very cheap courses and practice tests from Udemy. Most of them have a 30-day return policy they honor immediately. I returned once (a while ago) a course I was not happy with, and I got the money back with no problems at all.I'm fully aware many instructor may not be very happy with their commission, as Udemy charges 50%+ for most of their courses. But for student this is a great alternative to 10 times more expensive rip-offs such as Pluralsight or CloudAcademy, to name just two.And don't forget to check their free courses, as many new instructors offer such quality deals when they try to take off. This is value you may get without paying one cent."

I always find courses available for topics I need to train in.Not all courses are high quality, but I feel like I've got a knack for telling the pro's from the amateur's. I would like a bit more in the previews before buying, but I believe that's up to the course creators themselves and not the platform itself.Good site, more helpful to go deep and learn something than just using youtube tuts."

Udemy,2020-02-27T10:51:18.000Z,1,"Udemy only offers their best deals to people who have never made an account. You need to make multiple accounts over and over just to take advantage of fair course pricing.For example they will offer you courses at a very low price (up to 94% off) if you have never registered an account. You can then buy literally as many courses as you want ALL for this discounted rate.However after purchasing 1 or more courses in one go, you will never get courses for that kind of discount again.They will show you courses for the same discount some weeks in the future but then when you go to the checkout, they will tell you that you aren't eligible and they will increase the price automatically, as literally all of their discounts are only ever for NEW customers.Also they unfairly give some people discounts and others none at all. For example my girlfriend gets more discounts than I do for some reason despite us having the same number of courses purchased on our profiles. Why is it that she can get up to 94% off and I can only get 85% off. We are the same age, from the same location etc. So what's left... Sexism perhaps?What-ever Udemy is using in order to calculate who should get discounts, it's totally unfair. The only way to fight back is just to make new accounts any time that you want to buy a course and take advantage of them just offering these discounts to ""new users"".I'm really disgusted and honestly it just encourages people to get them from ""elsewhere"" for free. Udemy, you really need to clean up your act. Stop offering only ""new"" members these discounts. Don't offer new members 94% off but then offer your current members only 90% off and think that we are too stupid to notice, or won't care."

I don't have any of the complaints I see here from other people like the video's that aren't buffering and the prices that change. For me the prices are always 90% off... I would recommend using this site if you're interested in learning new things."

Udemy,2020-01-25T10:20:06.000Z,1,What a business model. The more you buy the more expensive it becomes. If you buy few courses you lose discount and if you open new account you get discount.
Udemy,2020-01-17T05:43:20.000Z,5,I loved the valuable lessons that I got on this website. Also nice discounts :)

Udemy,2020-01-07T14:45:18.000Z,1,"The website hosts decent courses. Every course I purchased worked successfully and I have learned a lot from the videos that I watched. I learned how to program in Java, and the web development boot camp course that I took was great, but I do not trust the company at all.What ruins this site for me is the approach that the company takes with marketing its courses. It is dishonest and it tricks you into believing that what you are buying has a higher value, which inevitably puts pressure on the customer to buy as much as possible in the ""limited time"" that they have. I have spent about £200 because of this and two years later they still have a ""limited time deal"" on every time I check the website.Especially since they use countdown timers and frequent use of slogans such as ""reinvent yourself"" which tricks you into believing your spending will be for the betterment of yourself, which inevitably removes any shred of doubt from your purchasing with a good justification.There is always a ""mega sale"" happening, where every course on the website is dramatically reduced from £199.99 to just £9.99 for a ""limited time"". Not to mention that the course creators are independent to udemy, it is not the company that creates the courses, and taking from feedback posted on social media from a few creators, udemy completely rips off their profits.There is also no verification that the creator is posting original content. There have been reports of creators creating courses out of other peoples YouTube videos and selling them on udemy to make money out of other peoples work.I do not trust this company. Not because the courses are bad, or that they did not deliver what they said they would, but because of how devious they are with their marketing tactics. Unethical."
Udemy,2020-01-06T19:50:19.000Z,1,None of the videos worked !! the help chat had me on there for an hour and all the things they asked me to do to try and make the video work didnt work!!! dont waste your money on this!!!!!!!
Udemy,2020-01-05T16:47:43.000Z,5,"Awesome platform to learn new skills which could be new languages or IT skills or marketing. There are hundreds of courses waiting for discovery by you.Although I don't like the new design of courses window in Udemy. There are some difficulties sometimes in playing video according to audio. Also when I click new messages sometimes they are not displayed properly. I like Udemy because it gives me a chance to get a certificate after completing a course. Then I can share it on social media and for example, apply for a better job. It helps a bit.Udemy is awesome for building professional competence in the job market nowadays."
Udemy,2020-01-03T00:13:18.000Z,4,"What I like is that even some of the courses that you can bought, if the course didn't fill your expectations you can easly request a refund, most of the courses teachers answer your question very fast."
Udemy,2019-12-18T09:15:19.000Z,5,"I don’t understand the criticism toward the content. There are thousands of courses, most if not all have a preview and you can see comments. Yes, some comments might not be reliable but you’ll find ones that thoroughly describes the user experience in depth. Great courses (over 25hrs long) for £10  is more than a bargain. In my opinion, this is democratizing learning.  Some years ago, my employer might have paid around $2,000 for courses that I can find here at a fraction of the cost.I’ve compared Linda (now LinkedIn Learning), Coursera and Udemy and the best value for money is by far Udemy."

He basically throws the ball to my bank to solve the issue by saying the fee will reverse immediately and this fee is charged by the bank while I sent him the evidence of screenshot from my account. I would say be careful to choose the courses and better never need to deal with customer service."

Visual supporting material doesn’t correspond to what the speaker is speaking about.When I went to the Udemy website it says they have flexible REFUND system. There’s a catch though: if you used Apple phone to download the app (like most of the users do), you can’t get a refund. You can only get credit back to your account, which you can use to get another course BUT ONLY on PC!!! Now it looks like I have to buy a PC to try another course.It’s undeliverable that Udemy DOESN'T check quality of the lectures it puts o its app. What i have seen looked more like a joke!DON’T WASTE MONEY!

I am a huge fa of Tara Brach and have for a number of years listened to her reflections and meditations as well as watching many of her video talks, so was looking forward to some new insights from her here as I suffer badly with chronic insomnia (and anxiety, as a result of this). But what I found was lots of re-hashed material with the label Anxiety & Insomnia stamped on it, a great deal of which I had already heard. As far as the insomnia was concerned, this was covered with a mere 7 minutes towards the end but all of this info was on her community wisdom section of her website at the end. I know it wasn't an expensive course, but I really was disappointed and wanted something more tailored rather than [re-existing material being rather clunkily cut and paste into a course."

They deactivated my Course which had huge following. I sent them a Verification Video. They are still not answering my emails and not changing status of my course to active. My whole following are waiting. Chatsupport said me this process takes less than 24h. I am waiting for them to review a 10 second video almost 5 days. They are very unprofessional. Live chat is just garbage. They are not telling more than ""you need to wait"" No help.This is pissing me off because they are just not email back even if it takes less than 1 minute to verify my course back again.I will change my platform in the future.

Udemy,2019-10-13T22:25:14.000Z,3,"I would like to leave  two and a half stars but the option does not seem to be there to do that. I have been buying these courses for years now and I can honestly say that I have not been able to complete any of them to the way they're intended. Despite the extensive tutor work that seems to go into them I have found them to be almost  useless because what seems to work for the instructor simply doesn't work for the student.If you tried to follow the instructions word for word, screen for screen you will find yourself unable to do so because tabs are missing, functions do not appear, error messages occur for no reason that can be addressed quickly and easily for any novice. To find answers you will have to go outside of the tuition framework in a hit and miss process that will often take you way outside the framework or scope of what is being taught. You will often end up working with a totally new version of what your'e trying to learn, seeking new instructions that are again hit or miss. The only way to learn is with an instructor right there in front of you experiencing exactly what you're experiencing on the screen at the time it is happening for you. This way the theory and practice can come to together in a way a novice can learn. That way the tutor will have to fix the things happening (or not!) on the students screen in a way that.s relevant to the framework of what s(he) is trying to teach: not several advanced levels above to fix the problems with the lesson that completely spoil the experience by the time the student has got to it."
Udemy,2019-10-06T08:16:37.000Z,5,"Great place to learn, as a student, about almost anything you can think of.On the other hand it is great that anyone can become a teacher using only their computer.Great times!"
Udemy,2019-10-04T09:03:29.000Z,3,"I'd give it 5 stars if their pricing wasn't so fake and screwed up.One day coursed will be $200, the next they'll be $12. It comes off as disingenuous and I don't understand why they constantly have ""sales"" which are essentially the REAL prices.Disregarding the pricing, there are a lot of great instructors and courses."
Udemy,2019-09-30T16:47:12.000Z,2,Facebook ad. Every time I opened the same link from a different device there was different pricing. This is bad business practice. I've got 3 screenshots within 5 minutes each one having a different price from the SAME course.. DON'T BE OVERCHARGED BECAUSE OF THIS.

Udemy,2019-09-24T14:29:33.000Z,1,"I wish I could give this company 0 star. I have been an Instructor on this platform for 6 months now, just providing free sample courses to students who are interested in my area and want to learn it. I have my own website and sell courses on there without Udemy and have been quite successfully too, but thought I'd try Udemy to see if this made changes for me and brought in new students. Unfortunately, the quality of students is poor. A lot of students enrol onto courses and do not do the work including assignments or downloadable work and many do not even watch all of the video lessons. Many are, quite frankly, ""lazy"" students who think that being spoon fed is the only way to learn anything. These students exist in Universities too and our school classrooms, but they seem to be bred on Udemy. For Udemy to then allow these same lazy students to actually rate and leave a comment for Instructors on their courses especially when they have not taken even a third of the classes or done any assignments, is beyond ridiculous! Students complain about free courses, free resources, free anything... these are the same poor quality students who would not thrive in normal life and real classrooms. I'm sorry to say but Udemy is not a place to learn, but a popularity content amongst students who want to be entertained and be spoon-fed and not actually do any of the work or learning. I think Udemy suits Instructors who are similar to their students, who do not have a real speciality and can somehow entertain students with their ""knowledge"". There are few exceptional experts in their fields on this platform but they are very rare - other than that you are really just learning from any old person off the street who decided to create a course and I am embarrassed to have my course on there. I am now trying to pursue Udemy to get my course off there because I feel embarrassed to have my name associated with this cheap ""school"". Furthermore, Udemy never provide accurate and timely reports on student and course status. For example, when I reached 1000 enrolled students, they sent an email then to tell me by first student had enrolled... very delayed and just poor all round service with a poor looking site and ""old"" feel. Their rules for ratings is ridiculous. For example, I had students leave comments like ""excellent course"" but with a 1-star rating, which is clearly the student mis-clicking the star rating they actually wanted to give, or just being lazy. This happens A LOT, and despite complaints to Udemy, Udemy themselves are too lazy to do anything about. The reason this affects Instructors is because this obviously affects the overall star-rating on course as a whole. For a course that's completely free, and I am making absolutely no money from it, all this headache and damage to reputation is not worth it. My main issue has been this unfairness around course ratings. A good school or university would never allow a student to pass or move on to another module on a course without completing prior modules, let along rate the school! Only good thing about Udemy is their chat service - they have good support staff on the other end who try their best and respond pretty quickly.I advice anyone who truly cares and respects teaching their field and has been thinking about using Udemy... please stay clear of it. I give it a few more years before it gets the official stamp of being a dumping ground for both poor quality students and courses! Stay away!"

Further to that they are too unprofessional to type out a personalised reply as they offered a 30 money back but failed to even bother to check the dates the courses were purchased. Such poor Customer Service and very poor willingness to assist. However very happy to keep the funds !! Certainly cheap ....and nasty !
Udemy,2019-09-11T05:02:50.000Z,3,"Great for buyers - intructors should stay away from this rip-off-money-machine that makes Udemy and a handful of instructors millions while an esteemed 98% of instructors work for next to nothing.Udemy promotes and pushes the same courses over and over, so if you teach in an area that already has a couple of good-selling courses, YOUR course will never be on top of the list or in the suggestions.Students can be vile. I have seen people signing up only to give instructors a bad rating, competitors or people with personal issues, then they disappear again, after they completely killed a new course of a professional person, who spent months on creating that course, and gets maybe 2.50USD per sale.It's ridiculous! Students buy courses for 10 USD and then they expect 24/7 instructor support, having all their questions answered and then they can't even be arsed to give that instructor a good rating.Students also don't read the course instructions and then give a bad rating because the course is supposedly ""too basic"" or ""too advanced"". They give 1 or 2 star ratings simply because they cannot read and practically destroy the course with their rating. Because once you are below 4.5 stars, nobody is going to buy your course anymore.I have seen a few courses of very experienced professionals, that were well done and offered exactly what was described in the course introduction. And yet, people leave 1 star-reviews and complain.Unbelievable how many entitled spoilt brats are out there.And the problem is, instructors need 5-10 good reviews to make up for a bad one. Udemy cares not about any of that, they just collect the money. So if you are an instructor and want to invest 3-6 months of full-time work so you can get some pocket money for a take-away dinner each month, then Udemy is the place for you."

Well, I had bought the course with a credit card I no longer have, and Udemy claims they cannot refund me any other way. They keep telling me to contact my financial institution??? I don’t have that info anymore. I offered to let them refund me via PayPal, visa gift card, old school check, or just give me another course free of charge, but they would do NONE of that. They claim they have only one way of refund.Customer service is nonexistent. Life time access means lifetime access, and I don’t know any other company that has only one way of refund.

These platforms for selling courses should at least vet the course so it is not spurting out free stuff for sale! A valuation of £199.99 is ridiculous for free content. Sellers should be made to sign a declaration that their content is NOT freely available to the public.Another point is that Udemy periodically sells courses at the 'original' price for a few days, which I think is so it can claim huge savings, and stay within legal selling policies, when in fact the courses are NORMALLY sold for less than 20 of whatever your currency is.Oh yes, its flat pricing is odd in my view. I'm not sure how the same course can be $20 USD and £20 GBP, when exchange rates and taxes would make those costs different for the same turnover.Clear your browser cookies or use different browsers for courses and browsing what to buy, just to make sure that you see the latest normal-price fake sale.I would ignore the course ratings as Udemy reminds learners to rate the course after the first lecture, which is really not a good indicator of how good the whole course is. It then goes on to nag you after every few lectures to rate again, and again, and again. You can tell the site to stop reminding you until the end of the course, but I wonder how many reviews are based on completing less than 15% of the courses. I have read many reviews themselves, and sometimes the review complains about something that is addressed later in the course.On a positive note, Udemy does offer a 30-day money-back guarantee in case you are not satisfied, and the range of courses is vast.I like that Udemy is NOT a subscription site, as I have not purchased enough courses to equal the value of a few month's of some sub. sites costs. Subscription sites may claim lifetime access, but what happens if you stop paying? Yes, no access.To summarise, * Check the tutor's YouTube channel first* Another fake sale is just around the corner, so don't be pressured to buy now* Clear browser cookies* Carefully consider the reviews and ratings* 30-day guarantee* Not a subscription site"
Udemy,2019-05-08T19:59:32.000Z,5,"I think udemy is great! I use it to learn practically everything. I currently have purchased 10 courses and have zero complaints about any of them. I like the fact that I can take them at my own speed. The only thing I would say (as mentioned by some other people but im not making a big deal about it at all) is that I noticed that the courses are always posted as if they are on sale for a short amount of time when really they are always on sale. I get that it's a marketing technique but I think you guys should just mark them at the solid price. It's very obvious and im sure everybody knows. The good thing is that the courses are solid and helpful and keep me coming back so I dont think there would be a problem getting customers as I feel you guys provide a great service. As far as the rest of my experience with Udemy, I am pleasantly pleased with how easy and quick it was to return a course. I have returned 3 courses because they werent what I thought they were going to be and had no issues and recieved my refund really fast!!! I just want to say keep it up!!"
Udemy,2019-05-08T17:29:56.000Z,5,"Love itAs it usually happens, users mostly share their negative experience. I just had one on a different platform and decided to take a chance to thank Udemy for fair business, clear product and excellent courses!I've purchased a few already (i think about 7... lol) and I'm really satisfied! Especially now when I have a comparison with what exists on the market :)One more ""thumbs up"" on top of the fair business is their customer support. Fast response, and when I got an issue with one course (I thought it'll be good for me but in the very beginning realized it was something different), they handled it with the utmost professionalism."
Udemy,2019-05-02T14:59:29.000Z,3,"Udemy is actually a great source of highly professional courses, but what bothers me much is that it's not possible to download the courses for offline viewing.I also would like to be able to watch the courses where I don't have a stable internet connection (for example when travelling by train to work). The excuse they want to protect the copyright of the video creators is very poor. There are already tools outside to download the videos illegally and I'm sure many courses are still available on illegal sites for ""free"" download. The only ones who suffer are the honest customers who just want to have a good usability and easy access to the courses wherever they are..The copyright paranoia nowadays is really annoying. As long as downloading on the laptop is not possible I will not consider buying courses there anymore."
Udemy,2019-04-30T19:22:24.000Z,5,No issues but research on the instructor is a must.
Udemy,2019-04-19T20:38:23.000Z,1,I am currently being harassed by Udemy via my private email for a very valid negative review I previously wrote on Trustpilot!!!
Udemy,2019-04-10T18:42:24.000Z,5,Great variety of courses! I am super happy that this platform exists. I have learned a lot.
Udemy,2019-04-06T09:27:43.000Z,1,"1. I have negative experience recently. I continue using them yet. Hope they would listen their users eventually. I've start using Udemy and was happy. I used to coupons and get price about 10$ per course. After some time they change my currency to RUB and make me pay only Rub there is no way to change currency.  So now all courses cost me 1000 RUB it equally 16$.Since I pay with Paypal , I have account in USD. And I have to convert USD to RUB with super low rate (Thanks PayPal too)  and final price become for me about 17$ per course.2. Recently I had price for all course about 900RUB and decide to find some coupon in internet. I found so many coupons with promise discount 95%. For compare I had course in list with full price about 5000 rub. And they suggest me discount 81% and final price was 900rub. So I've applied this code. And all course turn into price 1000RUB. And there is no way to turn it back. Support just get rid of me. Send me some other fat coupon that didn't change nothing. Annoying service."
Udemy,2019-03-22T06:46:06.000Z,5,Definitely best e-learning website! Forget about presencial courses that costs hundred of euros and in the end of the day you don't really get everything that was reached during classes. Buy a 10€ course on Udemy and watch great courses at your on pace!
Udemy,2019-03-18T10:32:16.000Z,5,"Udemy is just a platform. Its learning features satisfy learners like me.The course's content is depended on the course's teacher. So many courses have sufficient quality (in content or video), but some are good or even great. Tips: always try the highest rated courses and read the reviews.You should keep visiting back Udemy because they usually offer a discount (around $12/course). I purchased dozen of courses without any hassle. If you want a refund, then you should give them a reasonable reason."
Udemy,2019-02-23T11:34:25.000Z,5,Have purchased android development course. Tutorials are good but i though i would be getting 1 to 1 online live class.Btw ready made online videos are good too. Thanks Udemy
Udemy,2019-01-28T20:47:34.000Z,5,A really good website to learn new topics I have been learning java from this site and found it really useful
Udemy,2019-01-25T12:42:58.000Z,1,"Payed the money, did not get the course! Its is so dissapointing! After a week i still don't get the course, the support went silent. Cancelled via iTunes my purchase and never will buy from here anymore."
Udemy,2019-01-21T20:16:37.000Z,4,"Have had a great experience so far on Udemy. I've signed up to a number of courses and I'm progressing through them at my own pace, which is so handy.The content on the courses I've done has been really good, and I've even started using what I've learned in my daily work life, which has been great - I've been getting a lot of recognition from seniors regarding my work.My only gripe would be that they appear to have a sale on all the time - If the courses really are that expensive, then why can't they just be reduced in price permanently? It almost comes across as a a marketing ploy to make it look like you're getting an even better deal - Plus, I'd be pretty annoyed if I had bought something at full price, only to see it being reduced to £10 a few days later. That's not really nice. Other than that I think it's great & have recommended it already to some colleagues!"
Udemy,2019-01-17T23:23:45.000Z,1,"If you try to refund, that was a awful experience. I emailed them, they replied 3 business days later. And No response my email again. They removed the course form my account, and I hasn’t get my refund after 5 business days right now."
Udemy,2019-01-10T20:48:15.000Z,5,"What do you like best?1)Udemy is a great source of knowledge and skill development study. It has a thousands of resources like self-pace or instructor guide tutorials for professional life.2)Hundreds of courses are available for free or low cost.3)Very accurate and detailed information about professional exams and certifications4)it’s a great platform for employees training and skill development within a workplaceWhat do you dislike?1)The main problem is learning platform, video streaming tutorials are very poor in quality.2)Some courses have not a good content but expensive pricing3)Very slow performance, server doesn’t response very often"
Udemy,2019-01-08T18:52:24.000Z,3,"I've been using Udemy for a while now and I've had a reasonably positive experience. The cost of the courses really was the first thing to attract me to the website and then the delivery; watch whenever you want, learn whenever you want - sounds perfect. I have progressed my learning thanks to Udemy. The whole concept of being able to move around in your daily life and have a full comprehensive course (if you find the right one) at the touch of your fingertips without necessarily having to download anything or carry around a backpack full of books is amazing. I've been able to learn just by loading up Udemy on my phone and expand my knowledge simply by pressing a few buttons on my phone. That being said, the delivery of this concept needs a lot of re-tweaking in my personal opinion. PRICING METHODS- The first negative aspect of Udemy is the pricing methods. I signed up initially for a course which cost around £12.99 and additionally bought another as part of an offer, believing I had saved some money. A few weeks later, both courses were some £3 cheaper and so I had actually spent more on the supposed 'deal' than if I had bought them separately, exclusive of the deal, a few weeks later. I then noticed the courses remained at this price for a few weeks before then rotating upwards from anywhere between the original price I paid and sometimes exceeding £100. This really confused me and it seemed shady. Why would you switch your prices up every few weeks? Other than to suck some people in with a seemingly good deal whilst charging others 20x the price those who bought the course weeks prior?This strange pricing method impacted me some months later when I was offered a course for £9.99 and then asked at the checkout to pay £29.99. I messaged Udemy Support and was met by a quick reply stating that this particular offer was for new customers only, despite me being logged into my account at the time of seeing this supposed offer and Udemy obviously being aware I was not a new customer at all. She then proceeded to offer me the course at it's original price and I bought it. Since then, I've seen this pricing scheme cycle the prices of courses from £9.99 to £199.99 and then back down, all the while advertising 'sale' prices. It's clearly not a sale but merely a tactic to sucker some unlucky customers into paying just over 20x the usual price. I don't consider this fair practice. The price drop should be clearly advertised and the fluctuations made accessible to potential customers, so that they know the price they are about to pay is nowhere near how much the course will be only 7-14 days later.LEGITIMACY OF COURSE CONTENT/TEACHERS- The second issue with Udemy is the legitimacy of teachers. I've been studying under an education/teaching brand operating on Udemy whose background appears sketchy at times and other times completely suspect. It makes me think just how qualified some of these teachers actually are and potentially how damaging it may be to a potential learner who is hoping to seek a level of education relative to a recognized academic level. I believe no instructor is vetted on their credentials and so you could theoretically open up shop claiming to be a PhD in psychology whilst having never finished high school. The end result is a fraudulent money incentivized business and a platform which harbours charlatans and crooks. This particular teacher I have just discussed is not so bad and a majority of his teachings are verified in the academic literature I have myself decided to invest in as I'm very serious in progressing into a particular field at a later date and using Udemy as a 'stepping stone' to academic education. This issue also trickles down into the standards of the courses, some of which are like mentioned, far from the standards of even a basic introductory beginner course at your local college or school. I have joined courses whereby the additional content is not available to use in furthering your studying and as a result you are met with a 'This file cannot be found' or something very similar. How irritating. You pay for a course, you want to do coursework/homework and your teacher cannot bring himself/herself to maintain and provide the materials!RELIABILITY- A third is the reliability of software implemented at Udemy. Good luck trying to get the Android app to work 50% of the time. The Android app is the only experience I've had with a smartphone compatible app from Udemy and in my opinion, based off many years using Android phones and experiencing the quality of apps available, it's barely at the average standard by which you should expect well known reputable brands to be offering services on. The app regularly makes novice errors easily rectified such as replaying videos you've already watched, when in memory and the app reloaded from memory it will play a video you may have watched several hours ago or perhaps even days ago as it fails to catch up with your activity and progress on the course. Developing a simple app with a simple browser plugin built-in would make the app way better seeing as you would get the full site features and not a watered down basic version. Admittedly, the main website works much better, that being on a desktop computer and on the desktop it's nice to look at; smooth, simple and easy to use. The mobile browser website is barely functional and they have for some reason done the same with the mobile site as they have done with the mobile app and limited what you can do on the mobile version considerably despite a large portion of their audience enjoying courses from the comfort of their smartphones. I can't seem to easily navigate to course reviews or any of the extended website and that's baring in mind most smartphones nowadays come with quad core processors and relatively good resolution screens - why skimp out on the most important aspects of the site when most phones with decent specs are now so easily affordable?Also I should mention the website runs really slow sometimes. Sometimes the slowness of the connection from the Udemy servers causes the quality of the video to skyrocket down to 144p which is annoying. This happens randomly and often stops me from studying as the quality is unbearable.OVERALL- A good concept with many ideas making Udemy a hit online education website, shame they haven't polished some of the rough edges off - Easy to access within reason and very simple to buy a course and get stuck in to something you really enjoy or want to enjoy learning about- A massive range of courses with some really good teachers but at the same time, take the 'certification' courses with a pinch of salt as pretty much all of them have no recognized accreditation governing body behind them and those that do may not have the credentials in the education industry to reinforce the certification given and/or match up to recognized and accredited courses. I would use Udemy as a very basic stepping stone towards further education, assuming that no one course on Udemy will cement your knowledge and guarantee you a foot onto the ladder of your chosen field. Use these courses as an accessory/supplement and not to be used as bonafide evidence of completing a body of work recognized by regulating authorities- WATCH OUT FOR THE STRANGE DRAMATIC PRICE FLUCTUATIONS! ONE MINUTE MY COURSE IS £9.99 AND THE NEXT IT'S £199.99! KEEP AN EYE ON THE PRICES AND MAKE SURE YOU GET IT AT THE PRICE IT USUALLY MAKES A FINAL DROP TO TO AVOID SPENDING WAY OVER WHAT THE COURSE WILL BE VALUED AT SOME DAYS OR WEEKS LATER3/5 from me. Overall a good site with a really good idea behind it but so many areas which make the site less than what it really could be."
Udemy,2018-12-31T13:41:32.000Z,4,"There are some really good courses on here. I don't know why they have to keep changing the cost of the course - just set a price, the same for everyone, and leave it. It is now well enough established they don't have to annoy people with gimmicks. I have purchased several courses and they were really good."
Udemy,2018-12-31T06:00:40.000Z,4,The courses are good but sometimes it's hard to understand teacher's English so it would be great if you guys can add subtitles for mobile version for videos.
Udemy,2018-12-29T23:27:22.000Z,1,"Saw a course advertised as *strikethrough* £199 *now* £10.99.Checked cashback sites and saw that they offered 25% back - great. Clicked through to site, the exact same course was now *strikethrough* £29.99 *now* £12.99.Instantly lost my trust and, therefore, my custom."
Udemy,2018-12-25T10:38:27.000Z,1,"Your price sceme to catch people, way you do it terrible. Very disappointed. I am a registered member and been studying with Udemy. Recent I found out that when not log in and just go to website it’s £10.99 but when I went to purchase the course by logging in the price become £39.99. On my mobile app, when I log in it it’s £19.99 but when I log in from the browser (safari) it’s all of sudden become £39.00. All of this matter of minutes of searching not by hours or days. It’s a shame as good as You are, Do you think people are blind and stupid."
Udemy,2018-12-16T09:26:04.000Z,5,"You need to take some time to find some pretty good professor, but after that time, you can find some really amazing course for around 10$. You just need to wait for the sales, but they came really often."
Udemy,2018-12-10T12:28:36.000Z,2,"I opened a business account in July and bought three courses. A personal matter then arose and it was not until about two or three weeks' ago I was able to access one of the courses. It was during my personal matter than someone was able to help with my website and so the two remaining courses that I had purchased and had not even accessed were no longer needed. I recently asked udemy for a refund of the two courses; they refused, citing the one calendar month refund. Despite explaining that something had arisen and that someone had stepped in to assist with my website etc, they refused. They did suggest a credit for another course. Due to their lack of understanding and patronising emails citing their T&Cs, I have just closed the account. I agree with other comments that the special offer tag does appear suspect; it's simply to lure buyers in."
Udemy,2018-12-04T14:02:13.000Z,1,"False advertising is the way this site makes it money, they will offer ""24 hour last chance deals"" that in truth last for weeksI have seen three courses with "" 24 hour deals"" last for a week now and still has the banner saying ""24 hour deal"" above themIt's totally illegal to do this!Udemy will find that out the hard way"

Udemy,2018-10-24T08:04:18.000Z,3,"I'd give Udemy 2.5 stars if I could for the following issues;1)  I totally disagree with their system of asking students to leave reviews so early into a course like within the first 4 or 5  videos (out of 60-90 or so) - this is done every time and so naturally the reviews you read cannot truly reflect the reality about that course, only the student's initial, first impressions.2)  The iPad version of the site is fairly faulty and almost unusable,3)  Everybody learns differently, but truthfully, while I've purchased around 6 courses, I don't actually feel like I've learned anything !4)  Their permanent 90% off sale doesn't fool anyone and only adds to their lack of honesty."
Udemy,2018-10-06T11:43:59.000Z,5,"The kain ramsay courses I have purpchased were absolutely amazing, very infomative and actually fun to learn. In addition to this, when I purchased a course that I wasn't too sure about and then requested a refund later on, they refunded me within the next hour without asking any questions. Very polite and understanding from my perspective, 5 stars from me!"

Udemy,2018-08-14T23:06:12.000Z,3,"Udemy has some good courses, however, a lot of them don’t offer what they claim.Furthermore, the timed discount is an absolute scam. Courses begin at €11. I logged in and suddenly it was €20. I removed cookies and logged into my VPN, and it was €11 again. Never pay more than the minimum for a course. The 95% discount is a plain marketing scheme.Their refund policy is excellent however, so if you’re not satisfied with a course you can easily get your money back."

Customer service is terrible -they haven't even replied. It seems that a number of peple are complaining about this site and also mentioning how pathetic the customer service is. Not a single reply to all 3 of my messagers. Maybe I'm being impatient, but if this is what you call customer service, then they really need to sort themselves out because people are waiting around while discounts are about to run out. It's very unfair to customers, as I can see there are others wwho have had this issue. I've even tried with a difffernt card, with a different Paypal, a different device. Nothing. Not a single word of re-assurance, either."
Udemy,2018-08-01T10:47:10.000Z,1,Have never used Udemy but would advise anyone against using them due to a certain instructor.  Dr Paul Rogers who is undertaling courses for English is a fraud.  He claims to have a doctorate  but this was bougjt from a degree mill in the USA.  He alsonhas no Masters or Undergraduate Degree which he claims.  He has recently admitted this in a Malaysia courtroom.  I would urge everyone to avoid these courses because they are tainted by a fraud.  There are many other courses which are undertaken by legitimate people.
Udemy,2018-07-16T20:47:09.000Z,2,"They have some really good courses, but their servers are just garbage, most of the time I cannot watch courses.

Udemy,2018-07-09T12:26:11.000Z,3,"I have purchased several courses on Udemy but eventually it didn't deliver what I expected. I think Udemy is getting too crowded with cheap marketing as it's getting to difficult to find a really good, valuable course"
Udemy,2018-06-13T19:15:16.000Z,1,"Their courses are incredibly cheap!!! same as the quality of the courses they have!Customer service is awful same as their courses, I complained about 3 courses listed on their website, because they were missing videos or audio, and they replied back to me that this should be solved between me and the tutor.

Udemy,2018-06-01T12:30:24.000Z,3,"The Good.....Udemy provides an assortment of courses at a reasonable price. So far, the classes that I have used have been good quality and very helpful. It's not like a traditional classroom where you have an instructor who can look over your shoulder and help you, but for an online class it's a lot of bang for your buck.The  Bad......I saw that Udemy participates in Ebates. I clicked through Ebates and I found that Udemy's sites had automatically jacked up their prices to more than cover the Ebates discount, making it more expensive to use Ebates than not using the program. I'm sure the practice isn't illegal, but it is unethical and hopefully a contract violation with Ebates. It would probably be a good idea for Ebates to dump them."
Udemy,2018-06-01T11:43:27.000Z,5,"Love it. Hours and hours of content and learning for +-10 to 13 euro's / 15 dollars. They should not ask for a course review so often though. Let me finish the course first, please! I also think they should make some sort of 'this teacher usually responds within..'  block, because I do notice a lot of difference  in regards to the responsiveness of the different teachers, and I think fast responses are vital to a good learning experience!"
Udemy,2018-05-22T06:08:35.000Z,4,I really love the UdemyThere are a lot of online courses out there but this is the one of the best because most of the courses are really cheap and also you can access them any time from anywhere
Udemy,2018-05-17T00:47:38.000Z,4,"Udemy is a great platform for both students and instructors. I must admit that not all instructors' materials are well thought out but the vast majority, based on my experience, are good. You will get a lot of info to work with both written and video content. Many come with quizzes that are really helpful in seeing if you are learning and what you need to brush up on."
Udemy,2018-05-16T13:26:33.000Z,4,"For me, Udemy is like bazaar. On my first impression, I was amazed by the supply of courses, so it bewildered me from what to choose. What happened I comprehended the reviews are overhyped and do not match the reality as most of them are being submitted after 10 minutes course. So the question what is the best to choose stays all relative. Anyways, what I liked was the tutors I took and the content, but I stopped attending Udemy, and all other paid online educators as a result of BitDegree discovery, who are as much good as their competitors but shares everything for free."
Udemy,2018-04-05T06:28:24.000Z,3,Overall the courses are good but their administration lacks competence.  I booked a course and found that while they advertised 14.99 when I went to pay the price shot up to 21.99.  I pressed the back button to be sure and of course their was a mistake in the pricing.  I have seen this many times so check the fees.
Udemy,2018-04-02T10:35:55.000Z,3,"Udemy is a respected vendor for good reason however, a guitar course that interested me 30 Mar 2018 would have me cost $13 with a US IP address, 13 euros with a Greek IP address and £13 with a UK IP address (a third more expensive than the USA). Guitar courses from other vendors are available from any IP address at a single price in US$. Ultimately, one must judge value for money and £13 is not a great deal but with more expensive courses, the premium charged to UK residents could be substantial."
Udemy,2018-03-29T09:09:11.000Z,5,Some of the best customer service I’ve ever experienced. And that is really hard to come by nowadays! The representative ‘Cindy’ was a great help.
Udemy,2018-03-23T16:31:24.000Z,2,"I signed up for a course that lasts for 30+ hours, and they ask me for a review after about 10 minutes! By this point in the material they hadn't even started the actual content of the course yet, they were still going on about ""how to get the most out of the material"", and all the usual intro stuff. They openly say they are penalized by Udemy if their course rating falls below 4.5 stars so they ask people to give them higher ratings - which most people do. It's a bit like if Amazon asked you to review a product before it had been delivered and was still in transit, or to review it based on the packaging it was delivered in.This means you have no way of knowing when going into a course that will take many hours of your time, whether it will be worth it at all.When you look through the ratings for a course, you'll find no-one that has actually completed the course reviewing it (at least not for the longer courses like the ones I have been looking at) - instead just giving a very early opinion of the course based on first impressions and if they ""like the presenter"". With course titles and descriptions that suggest you will be able to charge for your services once completing the course (like with a lot of the application development courses) there is an apparent lack of people that come back once they have completed the course and say""Yes, I did this, it was great because of ...., and I can now earn money doing...."".I like the idea of the collection of online courses, and the one I am doing is ok, but the way they are manipulating the ratings to make it impossible for students signing up to the site to make an informed decision about what is a good course, is poor. Further more, the pricing system of ""4 days left at reduced price"" is a sham - courses offered at  £200 now £10 for a few days is a lie - the price varies depending on the device you browse from, evidently using cookies to push you into signing up.All in all, this is not a service focused on getting talented trainers together with keen students and rewarding the best trainers and courses. Instead it is a business designed to push as many people to pay for courses as possible. Whether they get any value or not of them is another matter."
Udemy,2018-03-21T22:47:11.000Z,4,"This website isn't for everyone. This review is based solely on the courses that I've paid for and the quality of the instructors that I've watched. I understand other people have had many customer service/payment/some headache on their end. I fortunately have not run into any trouble, so here's a perspective if you don't run into any problems like me. I've paid for a few basic photography, sketching, adobe cc, and sketch/java courses all on sale. To generalize my overall experience, it's been a pretty smooth experience buying and learning from the courses. The instructors I've watched are pretty helpful and they've taught me important foundational things as well as solid tips and tricks. Some instructors are from different countries, so they may have accents where you have to decipher their speech. Some instructors aren't as exciting to watch as others. Some instructors are very responsive when you have questions regarding the topic, and some aren't.  In the end, I can definitively say that I've gained a few skills from Udemy. Sure, it's not the most perfect learning tool, but sometimes you can gain little nuggets of information you wouldn't otherwise get from youtube. I would recommend this site because I don't find it to be a very expensive site for investing in your education. It's convenient, and you can pick up where you left off at any time. If you want to avoid some of the aforementioned headaches that other people have noted in their reviews, Lynda.com or Khan Academy are really good alternative sites for learning, depending on what you're aiming for.I try not to overlap courses of the same topic, and I buy by ear by reading reviews and watching free samples from the course beforehand. The most helpful thing I can tell you to do, is wait for your course to go on sale, or have a promo code ready. There are only some courses I'd pay full retail, and others I would definitely not."
Udemy,2018-03-21T22:28:02.000Z,4,I have not had any issues requiring me to contact Udemy and hope that continues.  I've purchased 8 courses at what I consider to be a fair price (<$10 each).  The content of each varies with the instructor but overall the information is adequate to good.  I make that judgement based on comparing what I already know about the subject compared to what is being taught. So far haven't found any outright nonsense and have picked up good tips from a different perspective.
Udemy,2018-03-16T12:51:54.000Z,1,"Customer support is non-existent, getting same reply , obviously copy and paste for 3 days , I would Udemy avoid at all costs."
Udemy,2018-03-12T08:01:33.000Z,1,"clearly rip offs 140.00 but 30.00 today on 5 hour courses they are biggest rip offs going also the amount of advertisement is a joke!! I really hope no one uses them. Lynda.com best learning resource out there for fraction of price. they have even got there own people reviewing themselves for good ratings . Please don't use these guys stay well away,!!"
Udemy,2018-03-07T16:44:27.000Z,5,I would recommend this company to anyone.
Udemy,2018-02-13T20:53:40.000Z,1,"If you are already in IT, don't subscribe to Udemy because courses are low level even if you have to pay. It is slow to lean on Udemy, tutorials don't provide useful techniques that can be useful on the market. Avoid at any price."
Udemy,2018-02-06T06:50:22.000Z,5,Excellent.Great format. Great courses. Great instructors.
Udemy,2018-01-19T23:41:34.000Z,1,"I have been put off using this site because it uses pricing pressures. A course was £11.99 for 5 hours, the next day it went to £14.99 (ok fair enough). But as soon as I switch browser from firefox to IE I can see the original cost of £11.99. They use your cookies to put your prices up!"
Udemy,2018-01-11T22:58:06.000Z,5,Really love Udemy. Brilliant educational resources. I much prefer udemy to pluralsight and Linda.
Udemy,2018-01-11T09:23:59.000Z,3,"The courses are great, however Udemy support is absolutely horrible which seems to be the norm within this industry.I have two concerns. I bought many courses on the promise that they were for lifetime. I was watching the Videos on my pace only to realize after a certain point of time that the course has been removed. On asking, they said it happens Once-in-a-while. I loved the course and it's really disappointing.The second is that some instructors will answer question and some just never do."
Udemy,2018-01-10T04:41:39.000Z,1,"I bought two courses promising lifetime access. They wewe remove from my page without any reason in advance. I contacted then, and they answered was we can not tell the reason. I am really upset with their professionalism. They are saying they are best in market, but Not."
Udemy,2017-12-11T08:37:09.000Z,3,"Many courses are good .. In any case, there are an extensive number that are difficult to understand simply poor instructing style. The great part is whether you begin the course immediately, you can get a full refund if it doesn't meet your desires."
Udemy,2017-10-07T01:03:56.000Z,1,Pathetic 😢😢its been the 24th August that I purchased 6 courses for my kids there was a problem sending the consultant instructed me to do a full refund and repurchase whilst waiting for the funds i bought another 6 courses 3 under each of the boys names thosw worked however to date I have paid for 12 courses only gpt 6 !!!!! And was just told that the refund apparently which eventually happened is with my bank accpunts department ofcourse after 1 month and some.odd days im yet tp recieve my refund and Udemy CANT or WONT do anything about it thisis the first time im dealing with them and im so upset and I keep.speaking to different people this is most unproffesional.
Udemy,2017-09-05T13:49:11.000Z,1,"I will change this rating when I am dealt with in one way or another by their non-existent customer care team. I am unable to log in to Udemy with Facebook, I should have just registered via email in all honesty. I have many courses on the platform that I need access too for work, being a web developer, so I need a quick turn around."
Udemy,2017-08-31T22:33:16.000Z,1,"Takes forever to open claiming it is downloading. The first time I got it to work, it did not list any of my bought courses. The second time, there were my courses - I just cannot access them. No explanation whatsoever. Waste of time."
Udemy,2017-08-28T07:12:07.000Z,2,I just signed up which was a bit spontaneous and now I have questions but can't find a phone number?Does anyone know how I talk to these people? And how do I download their notes from and iPad?Thanks for reading Leisa
Udemy,2017-08-27T19:58:48.000Z,1,"Initially I was very happy with Udemy as a new instructor, but this changed dramatically after posting my first course.Out of the blue I was asked to ""verify my identity"". This is a very invasive and disturbing request (you enter very detailed private information into an unknown website, much like applying for a loan). I did as requested, but the verification process failed without explanation. Note that I didn't originally agree this validation process. Note also that I was a new author with poor sales so the company had little to gain by this process.I went through the alternate verification process (emailing them a video essentially claiming I was who I was) and received no response from Udemy.I asked repeatedly for an explanation and/or instructions, but received no response from Udemy.My course has been banned even though I've followed all the instructions given to me. I feel bullied and confused.If you're a new instructor, I'd avoid Udemy and consider one of many alternative companies."
Udemy,2017-08-01T07:47:38.000Z,4,Great job but live interaction is missing
Udemy,2017-08-01T07:10:59.000Z,4,"Brilliant website with lots of fascinating courses. Some of these are bit expensive, but there are often sales on where you can get a course for ten bucks. Really been developing my programming skills through this. My only two real complaints are that sometimes a feels like learning to draw by tracing: you're just aping what they tell you rather than learning, also, I don't think there is any accredited certification for completing the courses like there is on Coursera. That would have been really great and I wouldn't mind spending a little extra for it."
Udemy,2017-06-30T14:08:58.000Z,1,"Faked Instructors - When previewing videos for two courses, I noticed I had seen them before! One on Youtube which is Free to view, and another one from InfiniteSkills. These I discovered after only 5 minutes of searching.I don't believe that people are paying money for a course they could of got free from Youtube!"
Udemy,2017-06-27T08:22:10.000Z,5,"Honestly I was skeptical at first, but after trying it my self I can say the site is very trustworthy, for example:- A refund for a course I accidentally bought took no more than 20 minutes to refund, just 20 minutes !- The udemy support team would get back to me within 24 hours or less, even multiple emails exchanged in this time including the weekends!- Support team helped with my issues where I couldn't log in, fixed it in no time- Site works great, no bugs I have found, plenty of content, and very good pricing and offers if I may say so myself.I am currently studying now and the videos work fine, no issues with frame rates, quality or buffering.I would highly recommend to anyone who doesn't mind spending £10 - £20 for studying material. For I.T. certifications it has an abundant amount of courses available."
Udemy,2017-06-25T13:46:01.000Z,1,"My laptop tells me the course costs 37$, my desktop tells me it costs 15$ and my phone tells me the price is 10$....I tried buying the course from all devices both with Paypal and 2 different cards, was not allowed to buy it with any of them. I write support who tells me my card is blocked by the bank and i therefor cant use it, i go buy something else with the card without any issues and writs back support, never got a answer. So all in all a company that has prices targeting your device and not a general price, and who hos a web shop that wont let you pay."
Udemy,2017-06-15T07:09:23.000Z,5,"10€ per course!Nice and comprehensive content, amazing and responsive teachers, very interesting offers. I love this website!"
Udemy,2017-06-12T23:44:58.000Z,4,very happy with the instructors who are passionate and knowledgeable.
Udemy,2017-05-06T07:44:49.000Z,3,"Sends to many offer-emails, the course-catalogue have varying quality of content, but in overall I'm pleased. I would give 5 stars, but Udemy keeps spamming my inbox. I like offer-emails, so I will not unsubrice, but I would appreciate just getting one e-mail every month. Get modest Udemy!"
Udemy,2017-05-02T09:49:47.000Z,1,"This review is from instructor side.  I have submitted  my video for test , and  I have resieved the answer, that it is not my video???  I have contacted   customer service. Keily from customer service, was very kind.  But,  she couldn't help me.  Thouse  guys from video test crew, just been kidding me.  I have been following  their own instructions.  Probably, they haven't read it.. Poor  management, not friendly stuff."
Udemy,2017-01-22T17:57:39.940Z,1,"I have read many stories about Udemy and payments issues, and a lot of them are not resolved after months. I paid for a course, have record of it on my credit card but the course never showed up on my profile. I wrote them and still no answer. This is common. Watch out."
Udemy,2017-01-18T13:20:08.957Z,5,"I was stuck and when i posted my question within a very short , short time i   received feedback. i expected it to take 48 hrs min. I was very impressed. not only were they fast, they anticipated my  problem since i was NOT completely clear in STATING IT,  *** KUDOS TO (LARAVEL) AND EDWIN DIAZ AND ALSO (REACT0 ANDREW MEAD."
Udemy,2016-12-22T16:24:25.000Z,5,"I get addicted to this thing! Buying courses one by one, learning new things and chatting with teachers. Could there be a better way to learn?What if you put those Netflix hours into something actually useful?"
Udemy,2016-07-24T03:36:08.000Z,5,"When I first started at Udemy I have to admit that I was jaded and was chomping at the bit to find flaws. I did find a lot of flaws and relished the opportunities provided to let customer service know about them. Not only was customer service magnanimous but they actually fixed all the problems that I brought up. I have since cancelled my Lynda.com subscription because Udemy provides a much better platform for people to learn. Because you actually get to talk to your teachers, you have way more tutorials about your subject of interest to choose from and the customer service is superb. Plus you get all kinds of deals all the time to make things really fun from a financial perspective. I love the site and can't say enough good things about them"
Udemy,2016-07-22T07:38:57.000Z,5,Their are a lot of courses and what I always like are the discount and promos. They do that everyday.
Udemy,2016-07-21T20:34:55.000Z,5,"I've had good experiences taking classes through Udemy. Most (not all) classes are also good communities to get involved with as well. Your fellow classmate can be a very helpful resource. The developer classes have a Udemy-wide facebook group. Most instructors respond to inquiries quickly, and are easy to communicate with. There are no subscriptions, so once you're in a class, you can refer to it for as long as it is there. You also have 30 day refund policy. Plenty of time to engage with the course to see how you might like it.I've been taking classes just over a year, and have found that the technology classes are updated, depending on the topic, and instructor. I'm sure experiences may vary, but mine has been very positive. I'd easily recommend to anyone wanting to learn something new. The classes are also reviewed, and I've found those to be fairly accurate too."
Udemy,2016-07-21T17:39:56.000Z,5,"I have completed many courses on Udemy. I am impressed by the high quality of the presentations and of the instructors. The instructors often bring with them their real-world experience gained from working with the material  they are presenting. The structure of the courses - audio, video and downloads gives an amazing level of detail to help the student understand the material and use it to create their own projects. A major feature is that you have lifetime access to the courses and many instructors ensure that their courses are constantly updated. This gives you the ability to take them at your own pace and review them as many times as you need to cover the new material.Great Learning Site!"
Udemy,2016-07-16T00:15:48.000Z,5,Excellent and high skilled materials and training videos
Udemy,2016-07-15T12:28:05.000Z,5,"I have found that the instructors do not simply provide a course.  They actually follow up with students and they keep improving the course.  No longer is learning simply buying a course and struggling to get through it.  Now, with Udemy you buy a course and have the course, the instructor and fellow students for a life time.  Learning becomes easier with all the additional help and no time frame.  Udemy is an excellent way to review material you know, learn material you need or simply review a subject you are interested in knowing."
Udemy,2016-07-15T03:20:23.000Z,5,"I have access to quality lectures from a diverse community of instructors on a limitless variety of topics at a fair and reasonable price. There are things that the standard structured academic curriculum is suited for, and then there are other things that only a site like Udemy can properly address. I don't think Udemy is a replacement for an academic degree program, and I don't think any academic degree program is adequate in today's world without continued learning via resources like Udemy, Udacity, EdX, Khan Academy, MIT Courseware, CMU OLI, and other high quality self-learning tools. They are complementary."
Udemy,2016-07-14T22:22:00.000Z,5,Udemy help me to achieve my goals.I enjoy to see profesional teachers explain his lessons.100% information to my learning. Thanks.
Udemy,2016-07-14T22:05:33.000Z,5,"Using the Udemy app to take piano lessons is awesome. I can study and review my courses from my iPhone, iPad and laptop.  It is fast and it allows me to download courses when I do not have Internet.  I love this technological method to make learning fun and easy to access Sandra"
Udemy,2016-07-14T19:18:48.000Z,5,"I started Udemy classes last year and it has been a very good investment! Before signing up for any class, I recommend reading the class reviews and searching online for information related to the subject that interests you. I have not been disappointed in any classes so far and I have my favorite teachers bookmarked. Udemy has been an excellent (and reasonably priced!) option for me to learn new information and I highly recommend it!"
Udemy,2016-07-14T17:18:21.000Z,4,Good platform easy to use I've done some excellent courses mostly on building websites. The cost of the courses are great and sometimes I can't believe that you can access such information for so little. I've also taken some free courses again most have been excellent. As with anything you buy online you need to check the reviews  and course content  and udemy make this easy to do. 🤓👍
Udemy,2016-07-14T16:47:37.000Z,5,"Make sure you view and look at what the courses teach. Sometimes there are several and one may touch areas that you are interested in more than another. I have been happy with all of the courses I have. You can also go back as much as needed to review your courses, even a year later. Once you buy it it stays in your courses."
Udemy,2016-07-14T16:06:55.000Z,5,"I find that the site is easy to navigate. The classes on here are great as I have learn everything from animation,modeling in 3D, and drawing."
Udemy,2016-07-14T15:42:08.000Z,4,There is a large selection of courses and most are reasonably priced.
Udemy,2016-07-14T15:00:22.000Z,5,"I've been a Udemy student for close to two years, and I love it. It's quick and easy to enroll in their courses, I can watch segments of courses when my schedule allows, and the prices are very reasonable (some courses are even free). There's a huge variety of topics, from cooking and spiritual development to computer programming and physics. Most of the instructors are knowledgeable and skilled, and will respond to questions quickly. I feel comfortable taking a risk on an unrated course, thanks to Udemy's money back guarantee. And the company actively looks for ways to improve their services. I've enthusiastically recommended Udemy to my friends, family, even random store clerks. Give them a try, you won't be sorry!"
Udemy,2016-07-14T14:05:44.000Z,5,I love udemy its a great place to learn
Udemy,2016-07-14T13:41:30.000Z,2,"Udemy was like a revelation.  I dove in headfirst and watched dozens of hours of videos.  Once the new interface was introduced though, I pretty much lost all interest.  It was annoying to use and unintuitive compared to the old one.I just checked and it seems they've made a few small improvements to the interface, but overall I still consider it vastly inferior to the old one where course content and discussions were logically placed and accessible without pausing or leaving the video screen."
Udemy,2016-07-14T13:27:01.000Z,5,"I love Udemy. One of it's biggest strengths is that students can leave ratings and reviews. If you see a course that has lots of students and lots of good reviews, you know it is a valuable resource. I am a fan for sure."
Udemy,2016-07-14T12:53:02.000Z,4,Udemy is a great learning site but it needs to improve by providing better services to non USA students. They need to offer better internet bandwidth especially to Indian customers. Their interface needs to work better with all the browsers. Recently I found there is a problem running it on Firefox.
Udemy,2016-07-14T11:03:20.000Z,5,"I started out with an abstract painting course by Andy Morris which was very good. The price attracted me initially, but soon I realized that the Udemy learning experience was ideal for those of us on limited time availabilty.I have enrolled in about a dozen course in a wide variety of subjects including art & music, marketing & technology. I look forward to the journey, learning and accomplishment.One thing that might interest younger people upgrading their skills for the workforce (like my son) would be to offer certificate level programs that get one up to speed quickly without having to go the unrealistically expensive university route...keep up the great work Udemy!"
Udemy,2016-07-14T09:49:19.000Z,4,"Most of the training are very good, well structured and easy to understand for non english native speaking person. The amount of training are just awesome and the price are just ridiculous."
Udemy,2016-07-14T07:31:46.000Z,3,"You can find a lot of good courses on Udemy. Unfortunately, their video player is working very slow and the q&a section is quite counterintuitive."
Udemy,2016-07-14T07:00:30.000Z,5,"I would recommend Udemy to invest inyourself, to knowledge of technical programming languages and many more."
Udemy,2016-07-14T05:44:22.000Z,5,Excellent in quality and pricesmany good offers as well
Udemy,2016-07-14T04:38:16.000Z,5,I feel that from the time i discovered udemy i have learnt a lot of thinks. The best think about udemy is that you have lifetime access to videos. Nice work keep educating people!!!
Udemy,2016-07-14T04:26:46.000Z,4,Udemy is a great place for me to learn about new skills. And because most of the teachers are real life industry practicioners; most of the materials they teach is directly practicable.
Udemy,2016-07-14T04:15:00.000Z,4,"In college you never know how your teacher is going to be.  Udemy is no different: I've had classes with inspirational, energetic and ""makes learning fun"" instructors, and I've had some total duds.The good outweigh the bad by a wide margin (and Udemy does have a ""money back guarantee,"" although I've never exercised it).Before the pricing structure change, it was absolutely the cheapest place to learn something online.  It's still cheap, but now I'm much more selective (post pricing change).Four Stars from me because:* Variable instructor/course content quality* Mildly clumsy UI (another recent change)* Recent pricing structure change (upwards, mostly)But everything is there, and very likely nowhere else.  Try 1-3 classes and decide for yourselves."
Udemy,2016-07-14T04:15:00.000Z,5,"I bought in Udemy a lot of IT courses that helped me to improve my knowledge in the area in a modern, attractive and efficient way."
Udemy,2016-07-14T04:10:48.000Z,5,"Attempting something new and find yourself confused? Udemy has the answer with a wide variety of courses that can be immediately accessed to answer questions. Excellent for visual learners. This year I've used these courses to learn to build WordPress websites, build and offer classes on those sites; review and master PowerPoint presentations, and work with videos. Pulling it all together now as I  upgrade my businesses."
Udemy,2016-07-14T04:08:04.000Z,1,I can't even remember how many times I've contacted customer service so I stop receiving promotional emails.  It seems they can't be turned off.  I also wanted to un-enroll from a free course I signed up for but that is not possible.  I get more unwanted emails from this 1 course that was free than anything else on the site.The UI went from decent to crappy with the change they made several months ago.  Now its not possible to see the questions others had with the lesson you are on unless you go into another area.  The entire UI is a lot less friendly overall too.  I've expressed my frustration to their customer service multiple times since they changed it.  I refuse to buy another course on udemy with the current UI they have.  I have +30 courses now with most I've paid for.  I'm super happy they wanted me to leave them a bad review today so I could remind them of all the problems.
Udemy,2016-07-14T04:00:41.000Z,5,Udemy offers great video courses at very reasonable cost.
Udemy,2016-07-14T03:20:53.000Z,5,I found relevant courses for an online business that I wanted to delve into and Udemy did a fantastic job helping me find the right courses that catapulted me on my e-commerce journey.
Udemy,2016-07-14T02:44:01.000Z,5,"I am glad that I created account on udemy. The course on udemy, their instructors, everything is excellent. And since they give lifetime access to any course I can learn at my own pace and at my own time. And also I can brush up or revise any topic anytime. :) :) Thanks team Udemy"
Udemy,2016-07-14T02:10:29.000Z,5,"I have loved Udemy since I first started taking their courses, Mostly I like that they allow the teacher more free rain to teach their courses in their own unique style. I have come to really like many of my teachers here, in fact I like them all so far and many have gone on to be friends on facebook. All the teacher I have had thus far, have been very knowledgeable on the subject they teach and seem to truly care about their students,. Yes. I am a very happy Udemy student ."
Udemy,2016-07-14T02:04:58.000Z,5,Great Learning Experience
Udemy,2016-07-14T01:33:19.000Z,5,"After taking many course from beginner to advanced, I feel very comfortable with course material, explanation(video)  and support (I always get feed back very fast).Thank you Udemy and Success."
Udemy,2016-07-14T01:06:30.000Z,4,If you know nothing of a subject and expect to master it by simply listening to the courses...you will be disappointed.  You will learn a lot but in the world of IT you will need to actually DO.       The courses I chose were both for review and for learning from scratch.  ALL of the instructors have been knowledgeable and responsive (in the courses I took) .  The review courses gave me the confidence to seek and acquire a couple of certifications I needed.     The learning courses were informative and in some courses you get quizzes and assignment to program to use what you may have learned.  When you need to review you go back and listen again.   Some of the instructors....English is not their first language and you can tell...HOWEVER they are clear and knowledgeable.  Consider it part of the learning experience if you ever hope to get a corporate job in IT.
Udemy,2016-07-14T00:05:47.000Z,5,The standards are high for classes on Udemy and I have taken so many that I can honestly say I know the instructors are professional and helpful. I highly recommend Udemy.
Udemy,2016-07-14T00:01:23.000Z,5,Very good place to learn
Udemy,2016-07-13T23:48:34.000Z,5,"I came across Udemy a little over two years ago and started with a free class just to see how it worked and if it was really worth it. After taking the first free class, it seemed to be similar to finding information anywhere on the web, but yet I was intrigued at how organized the information was and how much variation in what was taught.I then looked at a few other classes and decided to take one that cost money. I was surprised at what was offered, how it was taught, and at a relatively inexpensive cost.After that first class, I was hooked. I have taken several paid classes and have also taken several free classes over the years and must say that I have never been unhappy. Don't get me wrong, there have been a few free ones that I was glad were free once I started them, but overall I have not been disappointed.I still have several classes left to take and several on my wishlist for the future, but being able to go at these at your own pace, when you want to work with them, and without any additional pressure, is great.I would not hesitate to recommend Udemy as a starting place, or for long-term learning! There are some excellent teachers and the list of courses continues to grow."
Udemy,2016-07-13T23:26:30.000Z,5,"I have taken many courses in computer programming and web development and have yet to take a course that wasted my time. I have taken some courses with overlapping subjects and each time I found that different instructors presented the same material in different ways, such that I found I was learning something new each time.  I highly recommend Udemy to anyone looking to learn something new or refresh their existing knowledge."
Udemy,2016-07-13T23:23:04.000Z,5,A need to say thanks Udemy. My experience was and still amazing. Thanks for this platform. Blessings!
Udemy,2016-07-13T23:13:30.000Z,4,"great platform, affordable courses, love the $10 promotion at the start of the year. Would like to be able to download courses to follow them when offline in a bus or flight. Also, it is too limited to technology, languages and a few other fields, but tech is the most inside udemy. It needs to expand into more academics, new areas."
Udemy,2016-07-13T00:41:18.000Z,5,"I have  been using Udemy for long time and am very happy with the courses and the customer service.The courses are for lifetime, always updated and never expire."
Udemy,2016-07-07T22:18:19.000Z,5,I've used UDEMY to keep myself up to date in my computer programming career.  I reinvented myself by learning mobile native and hybrid app development.  I also used my new skills to begin teaching software programming at a local tech college.  The cost of these courses--along with the lifetime access (for those too-frequent busy times)--is simply amazing.  No subscription fees!
Udemy,2016-07-04T17:49:49.000Z,4,"Very diverse selection of high quality courses, unmatched by other online course websites.The app is great except for two minor issues:1- This problem affects both the mobile and web apps: Once you enroll in a course, you can no longer easily see the initial course information page that you based your decision to enroll on. There is no way to see it again other than to log out and view the course page as a non-subscriber. There should be a link to see that page while logged into the app.2- This problem is applicable only to the mobile app: If I turn off the screen of my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 while a course is playing, sometimes the course pauses and sometimes it does not and the audio keeps going on after the screen is off. I don't know the conditions leading to one happening or the other. I would like the option to control this behavior like with the Audible app. Sometimes I want to keep the audio going even while the screen is turned off, because it is primarily an audio-based course and I am doing something else and have the phone in my pocket while listening on my wireless earphones."
Udemy,2016-07-01T08:50:35.000Z,5,"I am a person who loves to learn new things, even if I don't put them into practise.Udemy courses go a long way to getting you started in something new, and there is help and support to help you go a bit further.The courses give you everything in one place, so you don't have to search the internet to learn things in bits and pieces.I have been very pleased with Udemy and I keep looking for new courses."
Udemy,2016-06-30T22:40:13.000Z,5,"I enjoy the model of purchasing lifetime access to the course.  There are plenty of interesting courses available.  Instructors are usually highly engaged to help.  If one waits for promotional pricing, a library of course work can be purchased and await your chance to take the classes when it suits you."
Udemy,2016-06-30T20:50:16.000Z,5,"I have signed up for over 60 courses, and everyone have something worth while to offer.  They are reasonably priced, and cover more material than most other online courses.I tell people all the time about Udemy, and hope to teach something using their platform someday."
Udemy,2016-06-30T13:08:49.000Z,3,I have found that the iPad needs alot of work. I have downloaded the trainings for offline and when on a plain or traveling it will play some ot not at all till I connect to the intenet. What is the point of offline if it does not work wihile not connected to the intenet?
Udemy,2016-06-30T12:45:33.000Z,4,lot's of contentquality of content not always the same
Udemy,2016-06-30T12:29:31.000Z,5,Udemy is a great site to learn new skills.
Udemy,2016-06-30T09:39:35.000Z,5,"I could find almost all topics in courses list about things I was wondering about how to do. Good quality site, precious information, very comprehensive level."
Udemy,2016-06-30T07:28:28.000Z,5,"I really like Udemy. Courses on many subjects. Find the best courses fast because highly rated courses are on top. With the best courses you can learn new things fast. Courses are getting more expensive, but still worth the price."
Udemy,2016-06-30T05:01:53.000Z,4,"Tons of courses, and most are really good. Some of them give you less than you thought but at these prices it's not a big risk."
Udemy,2016-06-30T04:28:44.000Z,5,It's one of the best online learning marketplace where I can almost always find what I want. Sometimes I get surprised when I see the courses I wouldn't think of finding there and that's one of the main reason I like this place. Another thing is that you can refund the course without any problem if you do not get along with it for some reason.
Udemy,2016-06-30T02:26:49.000Z,5,"What I could say other than Udemy is the best online academy I found so far. If you are not satisfied, you will not lose your money. You can also take the course you bought as many as you want for ever. It is great investment."
Udemy,2016-06-30T02:13:38.000Z,5,"This is the future education the online education, It's great, I hope many courses in spanish language or spanish subtitule to many Latin people.Thanks UDEMY"
Udemy,2016-06-30T01:52:27.000Z,5,"I've signed up for probably more classes than I actually have time to take, but each course is divided into easily digestible chunks so I can take a class in 10 minute spurts when I have a few minutes to spare. I love the choices on this site - I'll never run out of things I want to study! And there are several free courses too, although they have sales all the time so nothing is out of my price range. I can't remember now how I first found this site, but I'm truly glad I did. I spend a lot of time on it."
Udemy,2016-06-30T01:45:34.000Z,5,"I am 68 years old and have been interested in programming for over 20 years and spent a lot of time with books trying to learn it and ""it don't come easy"".Udemy has solved that problem with a multitude of courses on just about any kind of programming you would want to learn at a very inexpensive price. The videos and lesson plans with lifetime access have increased my desire and will to start learning again. I can stop and come back as many times a day as I want. The instructors get back to you if you have questions. It is a delightful experience.I currently have over 100 courses thru Udemy ranging from all forms of programming, game making, Photoshop, learn Guitar etc. I obviously will not finish them all but I will have full access to them all for reference any time I need them.Thank you Udemy for making my retirement a fun and enjoyable learning experience."
Udemy,2016-06-30T00:40:12.000Z,4,"My honest review of Udemy. Udemy is a great place to both learn new skills and investigate possible opportunities for new skills.Not everything in Udemy you may want to learn or to learn in the process adopted. Sometimes the instructors can be a little tricky, but I have discovered several honest instructors that are interested in their students succeeding.Be warned, the most popular courses aren't always the best ones. You need to take the instructor with a grain of salt. Sometimes the course might be a out of date, but you may still get your money's worth as the information might be hard to find elsewhere. Some instructors are tricky in that they offer a course, and when you buy, they then tell you that they have a new course with more up-to-date material on it. Some instructors are con-ish.Do your research if you want to save money! Some courses are just abandoned. Some instructors teach information that you can just find on Youtube. Last of all, there are instructors that up date their course material frequently and don't have any gimmicks or traps for you.Read the reviews and search deep for the good reviews, and in saying that, take most of the reviews with a grain of salt. If the reviews seem to be consistent about lack of updates or not very in-depth, then it's worth noting that many students have had similar experiences.Udemy can be a good place to start a new career, maybe as an introduction, to something bigger and greater.Give it a go, but don't put your head too high into the clouds, as you might be disappointed.Always wait for the sales, they come fast and often.I have been refunded once on a course, and the transaction was smooth and easy."
Udemy,2016-06-29T23:58:45.000Z,5,"In my field as web designer and developer I need to stay up to date with the latest trends, market demands and strategies as well as software. Besides another e-learning service focussed more on coding, I have found Udemy to be an excellent resource to stay up to date and also learn new things whether they are business related or not.To find the best courses out there, as with any product or service, I do recommend to investigate and compare the course you'd like to enroll in well to see what you'll learn and what other people's opinions are about the course. Read the description, watch the promo video as well as the free lessons if available and read the reviews to get a good impression. I've been on Udemy for several of years now and not once did I feel the need to ask for a refund.Another thing I really like about Udemy is that you pay only once and get lifetime access to the purchased course which, for me, is a big plus with the overwhelming amount of subscription services these days.I huge thank you to Udemy and their teachers for their awesomeness."
Udemy,2016-06-29T22:58:54.000Z,4,"Many courses are excellent. But, there are a large number that are hard to understand because of accents or just poor teaching style. The good part is if you start the course right away, you can get a full refund if it does not meet your needs."
Udemy,2016-06-29T22:24:39.000Z,5,There is a huge range of courses on Udemy. I like Udemy because I only pay for courses that I enrol in. Once I have paid for a course I have access for life. I don't have to pay for a monthly subscription. I can do the courses at my own rate and at the end of the course I receive a certificate. Udemy is a great place to learn about practically anything. The courses are very reasonably priced and I have received great value for my money
Udemy,2016-06-29T21:56:58.000Z,5,"I turn to Udemy whenever there is something I need to learn for work. There's a huge selection of courses to choose from! And I have to admit, I'm a little addicted to video learning!"
Udemy,2016-06-29T21:19:29.000Z,5,Best learning site around. Price/Performance ratio is more than you pay for. Great lecturers and wide selection of vary domain topics and courses.
Udemy,2016-06-29T21:11:06.000Z,5,Every course or trainning you could possibly imagine in one place! Play Watch Learn Repeat!!
Udemy,2016-06-29T20:53:58.000Z,4,"I've taken a number of Udemy courses and love the convenience of learning wherever I am, whenever I have some free time.  You can download lessons and play them while on the bus or train, or watch on the couch after work.  There's a great range of courses too, in all sorts of subjects."
Udemy,2016-06-29T20:48:18.000Z,5,"Before Udemy, I would have to read books and ebooks.  Now the instruction on-line is faster and easier and the light bulb comes on quicker because I find that reading is less effective than the on-line training.  Have done Hadoop, AngularJs, Bootcamp, NodeJs , Cassandra, and several others.  Would recommend these courses for both initial learning and refreshers."
Udemy,2016-06-29T20:44:28.000Z,4,I do like Udemy because I can pay per course and not per month. They offer a lot of courses.
Udemy,2016-06-29T19:53:02.000Z,5,You get very quick response from the instructors. Instructors are ready to clear your doubts in any time. I had a very good experience when I asked a question to the instructor whose course I had not enrolled also. I was amazed to see very quick response from Eric Clarke with a satisfying answer. I mean udemy is great because of its instructors. Udemy rocks.
Udemy,2016-06-29T19:42:12.000Z,4,"I have done a lot of courses through Udemy, probably over 20. Most were excellent, but some lecturers repeate their courses under different titles, which I hate.Also some of the courses are read in such bad English that is impossible to  understand."
Udemy,2016-06-29T19:23:01.000Z,5,Never have any doughts when it comes to learn new things in your own pace and your own platform. Very good teachers that make you feel relaxed when learning
Udemy,2016-06-29T18:56:15.000Z,5,"Generally, very high quality instruction for the money. Very good coverage of applied graphic arts."
Udemy,2016-06-29T18:52:34.000Z,5,"Excellant courses , teachers, prices are very reasonable. I would highly recommend"
Udemy,2016-06-29T18:28:23.000Z,5,I have completed close to 30 of the courses on Udemy with 24 more purchased and waiting. I have found all of these to be of exceptional value for your dollar. Most instructors keep adding additional content to your purchased courses and you are notified of changes as they are added by the instructors themselves. Some have live chat sessions or actual in person meet-ups announced I have not attended any of these yet but plan to in the future.The interface recently had a major upgrade improving the learning experience by a factor of 10 in my opinion.
Udemy,2016-06-29T18:24:51.000Z,5,"I'm working through 3 programming courses at once right now and loving every minute of it.  The instructors are excellent, and the material top notch and current.  True, I sampled a number of video courses before I found the ones that match my learning style, but that's the strength of Udemy, where there's courses from different viewpoints, and you can pick the courses that work for you, some starting slowly for beginners and others for existing programmers to jump right in.  The programming courses are fantastic, whether for web development or mobile apps, and my programming skill has developed and increased many fold!  I totally recommend Udemy courses."
Udemy,2016-06-29T18:20:56.000Z,5,I started learning on Udemy over 1 year ago and already feel like I have learnt more in that time then I ever did at school or college. As I can as much as I want and whenever I want to thanks to all courses having lifetime access. I have learnt so much that I was able to gain my dream job after doing several courses on Udemy and will still continue to study on Udemy for as long as the site remains.
Udemy,2016-06-29T18:09:47.000Z,5,I took tons of courses and Udemy is just great.
Udemy,2016-06-29T18:00:28.000Z,5,"Udemy is an amazing learning environment with over thousands of great courses that you can learn from. I love all of the teachers and support staff, they are always willing to hemp. Thank you so much Udemy!!"
Udemy,2016-06-29T17:58:40.000Z,5,I have taken several training class on Udemy.com and will continue to purchase the various training classes because they are the best on the market. I have yet to find anywhere that compares.
Udemy,2016-06-29T17:52:35.000Z,5,Read the reviews to know what to expect and wait for a price you are comfortable with
Udemy,2016-06-29T17:43:47.000Z,5,"Udemy helps me a lot teaching me languages, frameworks and more. Everyone can learn and teach everything"
Udemy,2016-06-29T17:40:27.000Z,5,I have found most all the training available on Udemy to be top-notch and I have found all the instructors to be enjoyable to listen to and learn.  I find the assortment of accents of the international cast of instructors to be a real positive.
Udemy,2016-06-29T17:39:55.000Z,5,They only have good teachers. The content is great and it's easy to learn who the best instructors are because the ratings are very accurate. I recommend this site to many people.
Udemy,2016-06-29T17:38:25.000Z,3,Pricing was good before they imposed limits on pricing now the price is inflated for most courses.  Definitely stopped buying as many courses as before
Udemy,2016-04-26T15:00:48.000Z,1,"Upon my attempted purchase a 16 usd course,the amount they actually try to charge (using Paypal) is 245 usd (woot).  Been trying to get in contact with the company, which surprisingly since they do teach you about CRM and conversion are pretty much impossible to get a hold of. The ""open support ticket"" form is not responsive/present so I cant even create a ticket nor is any other contact options suggested.  I mean really? And your supposed to teach people about best practices when it comes to digital services and online presence?"
Udemy,2016-04-20T19:43:50.000Z,1,"If you proceed with Udemy, be aware there seems to be serious backend problems, and you might get bitten, as I have. If you DO have a problem, such as missing courses, be aware that -- incredibly, for a site that the champion of business excellence, Seth Godin, has endorsed (and has content on) -- Udemy's apparently skeletal customer support may not resolve the problem in a timely fashion, or even at all. My story: Opened a Udemy account Jan 2015, purchased 7 courses up to March 2016. Got some great stuff and was about halfway through some of them, when, in March 2016, all my courses were removed from my account without warning or explanation. I also got a new welcome letter, in French (I'm not kidding). Have patiently supplied the email receipts of the courses I bought and Udemy is not doing a thing to resolve it by restoring access or a refund/credit, even though they promise a ""lifetime guarantee"" to the courses. I bought these products, and they are not being supplied. I get emails that say this:  ""I’m sorry for this trouble! I will be forwarding your concern to the appropriate team to further research this issue for you. You should receive a message from them shortly."" But there's been no contact from the ""appropriate team."" I don't want ""research,"" I want resolution. I don't have a ""concern"" I have a broken transaction! I want the products I purchased. How hard is it to restore access to the courses I purchased, or put a credit on my account so I can repurchase my courses and get back to work? This is precisely what I've asked for several times, and my request is ignored. A textbook example of how NOT to do Customer Support. I've looked, but there is no phone number to call. There's no chat with support on the site. You have to fill out a form and wait for a reply. My replies have come at 6 pm my time, once a day. I would think, for the revenues this site must be generating, they afford some customer support. This is more problematic than it may seem. I am wondering why this is bothering me so much, and I realize that it's more than just a ""product."" I'm seriously invested, and I'm seriously let down.  Think about the personal investment a person makes to work through an online course. Think about a person trying to bootstrap their life, or their career. I set aside three days this month -- turned down paying work -- to work on these courses and improve my life. Not only are my courses gone, but so are all of my progress markers, online messages with instructors and classmates, updates, and any access to the downloads and instructors (it's all handled through the site). I have invested a large amount of time in these courses. For two of these courses, I've put in around 40 hours of time. I have thick notebooks filled with notes and printout from the courses -- half done. I cannot complete them and am cut off from the instructors and communities surrounding them.  I feel as though I have been kicked out of school.  OK then, now I am picking up the pieces, cheering myself on, and finding another way to move forward."
Udemy,2015-11-17T00:04:08.117Z,1,"Tried to sign up for a course. Payment screen did not work. ONLY WAY TO CONTACT COMPANY IS THROUGH AN INTERNAL MESSAGING SYSTEM. There is no phone number listed on site at all. Googled their number. One number comes up and when you call there is either no answer or a message states that ""the Google subscriber is not available"". The Google subscriber? The company has no phone number? Now I am glad my payment did not do through as this has SCAM written all over it!  doubt the physical office in SF is legit either."
Udemy,2015-10-03T21:48:16.732Z,4,"I am member on Udemy for about six months, and since then I am regularly taking courses on web development. They are offering a lot of good sounding courses. The quality of courses is not always the best, but there is a good system of peer reviews, which is of great help when choosing a course.The Udemy team is constantly working on improving the overall quality of their site. Recently, they introduced new regulations and improved their HTML player.The only downside of the membership is the constant bombardement with offers. The official announcements, made by instructors are treated as equal, even if some of them are clearly marketing offers, whereas the others are updates to courses."
Udemy,2015-09-05T20:41:14.074Z,1,"I had a coupon for any class at Udemy.com for $10.00 that came in the mail. I tried to enroll in a class, and it stated the coupon was not valid. I emailed customer service, and was given a new code to use, but that didn't work either. I was assured that the code would work so that I could enroll in a certain class by a woman named Kerbyn, so I emailed her again at Udemy but got absolutely no response at all. I tried calling two different phone numbers and left a message at one, and the other voice message answering system said the mail box was full. I was given a cut off time of about 24 hours to enroll with the second coupon, and I am still not enrolled in the class. Even though there is a publicized phone number for Udemy, no one answers the phone or returns calls."
Udemy,2015-08-31T16:44:09.467Z,5,I check Udemy daily and download various courses.  I think I'm a bit addicted to Udemy and I'm super glad I found it.  I tell people about Udemy all the time.
Udemy,2015-08-30T06:57:06.735Z,5,"Udemy is a great site for anyone who loves to learn. There is a variety of quality in the classes, and some you will find interesting and some you will not, but if you are patient you will definitely find something to suit your tastes."
Udemy,2015-08-29T21:47:36.153Z,5,"Udemy offers a wide range of subjects to delve into.  They range in cost from $0 to a few hundred dollars.  Some are just intro courses that give you a taste of the subject, while others fully immerse you in the material, especially the courses related to computer programs.  I highly recommend Udemy.  In addition to the courses themselves, the customer service is very responsive to any issues that occur.  Without reservation, I give Udemy 5 stars."
Udemy,2015-08-24T01:53:52.984Z,5,"I bought a Udemy course from an individual who normally sells his information on Jvzoo and Warrior Plus. I didn't complete the course for a long time and ignored Udemy's emails because I did not want to pay the normal course prices. One day recently I did open an email from Udemy offering all the courses at dramatically reduced prices so I signed up for a few in areas of interest to me. I have since completed 24 programs with many more in the cue for when I get time to consume the content. It's fair to say though I wasn't an early adopter to this format I am a loyal convert. I so believe in the world wide need for this online way of learning... I have plans to start promoting Udemy courses as an affiliate in the near future - just as soon as the website I plan to market with has the required web traffic to qualify me as an affiliate for Udemy."
Udemy,2015-08-22T22:03:04.854Z,5,"Udemy offers courses on just about everything. Instructors come from all walks of life, and you get to rate their courses. Courses range in price from free to a couple hundred dollars; however, heavily discounted pricing with coupons and specials are available often."
Udemy,2015-08-21T22:34:15.987Z,5,"The platform is great to gain exposure to great online courses. Udemy keeps the interface simple for easy navigation. Really enjoy the 5 minute preview option and the discount which allows students to purchase courses for $10. Udemy's ranking system allows students to quickly find the best courses via reviews and popularity is great!  Would like to see promotions of ways to win credits to purchase courses:)"
Udemy,2015-08-20T01:17:32.690Z,5,"I think Udemy is one of the best places to learn virtually anything online. I really appreciate the wide variety of subjects. All the instructors are highly interactive, so its super easy to get answers to anything that isn't clear. I'm also thankful that the pricing allows people with limited funds to still take advantage of these courses, and better still gain knowledge that can help them change that situation. UDEMY ROCKS! =)"
Udemy,2015-08-19T11:49:17.943Z,5,"If I have learnt many things which interests me, it is because of Udemy. In the world of education, the quality comes at a cost. With Udemy, I've been able to learn a lot of topics with few of the globally best instructors and veterans (which we can never learn in our schools or colleges). Thank you Udemy, I'm really grateful to you :) Best Wishes,Sriranga"
Udemy,2015-08-19T09:56:58.925Z,5,"Amazing, I can't get enough courses"
Udemy,2015-08-19T07:03:59.926Z,3,"Some courses are very expensive.  Would like to see a Teeline course.Video in some places really choppy."
Udemy,2015-08-17T23:45:29.000Z,5,Thank you to Udemy for a professional fabulous looking site that works. I have teaching online at the platform for just over 12 months now and am delighted with how my business in expanding. The feedback from the team behind the platform is great. Good interaction between teachers on several social media sites that work well to help the entire community. They host an amazing array of courses that make them a very rich experience for all.
Udemy,2015-08-17T05:47:42.117Z,5,It makes my learning journey faster and more enjoyable essentially switching from one device to another :-)
Udemy,2015-08-16T15:41:38.132Z,3,"Udemy is the closest thing to democratized education. Instructors are allowed to set their prices to whatever the market will bear. Student are allowed to choose any and how many courses their heart desires. But the thing that makes it great is the same thing that hurts it. There's a massive variation in quality instruction, although most courses offer a 30 day money back guarantee. I've never actually used it, so for now, its caveat emptor... buyer beware.  Their digital certificates aren't worth two hoots and the examinations tend to be very poorly executed. A lot of courses are re hashed from other websites like Youtube. But, overall, there are some great courses for cheap, so I still think it can be a decent deal for some."
Udemy,2015-08-16T07:44:42.644Z,5,I've no words to praise Udemy's effort. But I wanna say they are doing fantastic Job.
Udemy,2015-08-16T03:03:11.625Z,3,"I love the idea of Udemy, however when I log onto the app on mobile it just isn't intuitive, it is slow, clunky and sometimes forgets what it has been prompted to do.  For example: while watching a video (esp on mobile) and I click completed in order to proceed to the next video it freezes and then I have to go back to the main screen of the course in order to forward to the following video. Maybe it is a 'traffic' or timing thing but certain times of the week and or day getting to my profile so that I can watch a video is difficult, so I don't even log on. Videos get stuck, it is a problem..."
Udemy,2015-08-15T19:51:48.022Z,5,Granted I have not even finished all the classes that I purchased but I have found Udemy to a huge asset in learn new skills that will get me to where I would like to be in life and I can take my time with them and learn at my own pace. With my chaotic schedule the monthly membership sites would be more stressfull for me thinking i was not going to get my money's worth if I was only able to look and a few videos every weekend. The photoshop course for web designers has really helped me out a lot. I just wish I had more time to go through all that I have got in my courses.
Udemy,2015-08-15T19:21:21.556Z,4,I have been enrolling in different online courses from different platforms. I found Udemy one of the best ones as it has a variety of topics and a high standard quality of the courses. There are lots of free courses available and also those that you have to pay have the option to read feedback and reviews from other students.
Udemy,2015-08-15T11:25:23.817Z,3,"Udemy works very well. The interface is easy enough to use and the only big improvement I'd like is the ability to upload from online storage like dropbox, GoogleDrive. My concern is about the emphasis on low value courses that trainers are placing on the site, which they price at $100-$500 and then discount down to $9 or less. Many of these courses are purporting how to make money on Udemy. These have the feel of a pyramid scheme. If you placed these courses early, you get all the benefit. It seems harder for new course providers to break in and the advice seems to be to secure a lot of free learners to show 'social proof' - further devaluing the platform. Udemy does seem to be in a bit of a downward spiral. I think the platform needs to ask: is it a platform largely targeted at the Get-rich-quick and affiliate markets or will they shift to being a platform that markets high quality learning. At the moment, they are trying to be both, but largely compromising the latter."
Udemy,2015-08-15T02:02:46.802Z,5,Many courses to choose from and all have been excellent. I highly recommend Udemy.
Udemy,2015-08-14T16:24:01.923Z,5,"You will learn from many experienced instructors, many of them are real-world experts. My computer skills have improved a lot (from zero to workable) such as HTML, CSS and simple iOS Apps."
Udemy,2015-08-14T15:33:28.214Z,5,"I've been purchasing classes from Udemy for a little over a year now watching class’s two, or sometime three, times a week. I love their business model, that is you purchase a course as opposed to subscription based style like other sites. I would highly recommend Udemy."
Udemy,2015-08-14T10:55:21.200Z,5,Udemy is a great site for finding courses on just about anything.
Udemy,2015-08-13T17:27:00.246Z,3,I would have rated 5/5 if they support alternative payment method other than Paypal. Such Payoneer.
Udemy,2015-08-13T15:47:11.076Z,5,"Lots of great courses. Many for free and many for really cheap. Thank UDEMY!"
Udemy,2015-08-13T12:20:31.761Z,4,"It is a good site to learn anything, but it has some courses that are less value than its price."
Udemy,2015-08-13T09:28:39.311Z,5,"5 Stars. I recommend it to any one who wants to learn.Thank you UDEMY. I wish I knew about it years ago."
Udemy,2015-08-13T09:23:13.489Z,3,now browsing course videos became very very slow which harms learning process
Udemy,2015-08-13T06:48:45.256Z,5,Courses are well structured and short.
Udemy,2015-08-13T06:21:23.255Z,4,Perfect content. Not perfect UX desktop and mobile versions.
Udemy,2015-08-13T03:31:32.118Z,5,"I really love that Udemy has various categories to choose from. Anywhere from free to paid. Some courses are highly practical in nature so you can do projects right away. There are some instructors who regularly respond in a few courses I noticed. These days most of us don't have time so not possible for all them to be there. Overall worth it. There are instructors from around the world. For some English is a challenge but make effort to do good job. Effort appreciated. Of course like anywhere fair to say some can improve their ability. Most have good video and audio quality. Some courses have quizzes, PDF and in some cases other downloads or links. Course downloads are available for tablets and phones only. PC is view able online only. Cost reasonable to high. You choose individually. Occasionally you do get sales from Udemy or coupoun offers from instructors. Enjoy learning!!"
Udemy,2015-08-13T01:18:44.814Z,5,Udemy has always been my first choice whenever i'm looking for information and study material for my references.
Udemy,2015-08-13T00:45:26.166Z,5,"I just love this place!  They have the best selection of courses - from the super easy to the thought provoking!... not to mention really great coupons :)"
Udemy,2015-08-12T23:49:04.823Z,4,Because of Udemy i can learn so many skills. Thank you Udemy :D
Udemy,2015-08-12T23:21:50.369Z,5,Great website for finding how to video tutorials
Udemy,2015-08-12T23:02:29.828Z,5,"I love to learn and I am visual, so when I can have a video especially and some expert is guiding through technical things, I will pay for them... When I first started,  I signed up for 3 courses, never finished them and thought,  Okay that was interesting. Now you have an abundance of course by a variety of experts. Only 1 course mismatched his promise and I gave a bad rating to, but  I only paid $10 for the course... I have my favorite teachers and expand my library...now I am in middle of making my own course(s) so I ama FAN, a Raving Fan of Udemy. I remember seeing the founder speak on tastytrade's Boostrapper series last year and his story inspired me to take another look at the site. I did and was glad for having done so.... Thank you... An Adult lover of learning new things..."
Udemy,2015-08-12T21:25:59.405Z,5,"I find Udemy courses to be highly instructive, high quality and very affordable and would enthusiastically recommend Udemy to anyone who is looking for a good resource to learn a new skill!"
Udemy,2015-08-12T20:53:06.723Z,5,"I found so many useful courses on Udemy being a student! And than, inspired by other instructor's experience, I decided to tell people what I know myself and what I can share with other people - option trading on commodity futures, both for fun and additional income! I have not found anything like Udemy on Internet! Thanks, guys!"
Udemy,2015-08-12T19:41:23.960Z,5,Great place for knowledge seekers to grab knowledge with less money and time. Great place for instructors to monetize their content.
Udemy,2015-08-12T19:28:56.239Z,4,"As a learner by doing, I have had and do still have a lot of benefits from the coures I have taken so far. Paul Deitel, Craig Buckler and Rob Percival are far the best instructors. A tip: Try to listen to some of the free lectures from the course you are interested in, then you may decide about you want to listen to the instructor (sometimes over an over again to comprehend the lecture). It is not all UDEMY instructors that are fluently in english and not all that have a pitch in voice that agrees with your nerves..blink-blik..Anyway, the level of learning are often ablove what is promised, you often learn something by the way the instructor does things, the programming environment etc.I have several courses in my learning pipeline awaiting my focus. Only if time and coffee was unlimited.."
Udemy,2015-08-12T19:11:20.853Z,5,"I love to do courses on udemy, all the instructors are knowledgeable and do not treat you as if you are a dummy. I hope to do a lot more learning with udemy."
Udemy,2015-08-12T18:16:33.305Z,5,"Udemy has changed my life over the past year that I've been taking their courses. The quality of information and presentation varies greatly from instructor to instructor, but the 30-day guarantee refund policy makes it easy to cancel a course if you're not satisfied. I've found a handful of instructors who've contributed immensely to my ongoing education and I've purchased multiple courses from several of my favorites. The mobile app makes it very easy to listen to lectures anywhere, so I often learn in the car on long road trips."
Udemy,2015-08-12T17:32:25.573Z,5,"Just very happy with the type of courses they run.Very prompt customer service. I've purchased and enjoyed the Amazon, writing, website building, combat, and various other coursesThe courses have been of great content. So i definitely give it a 5 star rating. Hopefully Udemy will continue the very high standards in the near future."
Udemy,2015-08-12T16:42:13.594Z,5,"Udemy has a multitude of courses in a multitude of different, mostly relevant categories.  Along with a solid review system, it's fairly easy to weed through the less effective courses and find the ""gold nuggets"" in the effective ones.   Another great aspect of Udemy is it's pretty much risk-free.  If you buy a course and it turns out to be lousy or not what you were looking for - their money back policy protects you if that does happen.   However, in my experiences with over 100 courses, at least 80% of them over some form of worth-while enrichment or education, making them well worth whatever price.  For anyone looking to self-educate, I highly recommend you consider some Udemy courses as they are truly excellent!"
Udemy,2015-08-12T16:19:38.658Z,5,"On Udemy, you see tutorials from much broader topics, and you get to experience much more organized videos that you can never have from YouTube."
Udemy,2015-08-12T14:51:13.522Z,4,"My primary interest is computer programming in various Microsoft technologies.  There's a large number of courses from various organizations & instructors.  Most are good, but content frequently overlaps.  When this happens maybe 20-80% overlaps what I've learned from another course.  The 30 day money-back is good, but I've rarely used.   Really appreciate it when all courses are on sale."
Udemy,2015-08-12T13:52:16.244Z,5,"Udemy is great. I have found many courses in different topics that will enhance my professional career and also other topics for my hobbies. The platform works really well, I can have access on different devices, and the updates are great.I am very pleased and recommend it to my friends and family."
Udemy,2015-08-12T13:33:29.281Z,5,"Very useful and cheep training website, I love it :)"
Udemy,2015-08-12T12:05:38.958Z,5,Great content from various authors. Previews available for most of the courses. Comes with money back guarantee on courses and you have them for life. They have sales all the time so load up your wishlist and wait for the sale. Excellent value for the money and time spent.
Udemy,2015-08-12T11:33:33.634Z,5,"I have enrolled in and completed more than ten courses on Udemy and I am very impressed with the quality of instruction and ease of use of the Udemy platform. I am able to seamlessly work through lectures on my desktop, laptop, Android tablet or iPhone, always picking up right where I left off.  The instructors are knowledgeable, the video and audio production of the lectures is outstanding and the skills and insights I have gained are making a big difference in my personal and professional life.  Each of the courses provides excellent value and my instructors have created a real sense of community through their discussion forums and the way in which they quickly answer student questions and frequently update the courses and add new lectures and resources. With more than 30,000 courses, there is something on Udemy for everyone."
Udemy,2015-08-12T11:23:58.754Z,5,Very comfortable easy to use and suggest very comprehensive learning method
Udemy,2015-08-12T09:53:58.152Z,5,"I've used many online learning platform and Udemy is the market leader for a good reason – it's the best.  Presenting long form HD video on demand to 7 million people, taking payments from all around the world, ensuring course quality, running affiliate and advertising campaigns, and all they do is NOT an easy feat. Udemy pulls it off very well. The company has a humble ethic as well which I like."
Udemy,2015-08-12T09:13:46.834Z,4,"It's a great place to learn and enhance your skills. My advice to anyone who wishes to join Udemy would be  - YOU MUST try a free preview before joining any course, to see if it suits your learning style and needs. - Udemy provides massive discounts on several courses, quite frequently if I might add. So, it'd a be good idea to wishlist courses that you'd like to join in."
Udemy,2015-08-12T09:06:07.346Z,5,"I have been in Information Technology for over 30 years and I must admit the courses are really good and well presented. I regularly purchase courses for my staff. Keep up the good work."
Udemy,2015-08-12T08:52:45.158Z,5,"I have been learning from udemy since 1 year.I got lots of skills and knowledge. I recommended to new learner please learn view udemy. It's the place to learn as ur desire. It's one kind of open collage where everybody can learn and share the skill from profesinal Thanks"
Udemy,2015-08-12T08:23:11.151Z,5,"Udemy is one of the best online courses sites, even if u have some courses with poor quality, you 'll find more with high quality in the same subject you 're searching for, and it gives you the opportunity to work from home too."
Udemy,2015-08-12T08:22:37.339Z,5,A curriculum of complete choice for work and for leisure accessible on personalised schedules with regular discounts available. Udemy is amazing.
Udemy,2015-08-12T08:22:34.089Z,5,"I have been learning a lot of different things with Udemy, the instructors teach at the pace I like and understand. I am at this moment helping my great grandson to learn to draw, he has a tremendous understanding, although he is only five years of age, I am 75, and we are learning together, I have forgotten most of what I was taught, and the school of art and the college of art, so I am very grateful to Udemy, for letting me play 'catch-up' :).My favourite learning goal at the moment is Photoshop, and my health and well-being, everything is there with Udemy, I love everything about it.Thank you for letting me share my appreciation of Udemy.Eddie the Eagle."
Udemy,2015-08-12T07:57:59.998Z,3,iOS app has tons of bugs and tons of missing features.
Udemy,2015-08-12T07:25:21.788Z,4,"While other platforms focus on specific areas, Udemy covers everything under the sun. Prices are competitive, and if you're patient you can get good offers.On the negative side, it is up to every teacher to make your experience great. Some are great, some might not ever reply to anything."
Udemy,2015-08-12T07:14:51.374Z,5,Wide variety of courses on different topics. Good instructors.
Udemy,2015-08-12T07:00:55.446Z,4,udemy is my one stop shop for changing and getting lean education within minutes!
Udemy,2015-08-12T06:41:15.789Z,5,Every course that i've attended up to now is great. Thank you very much for such an awesome web page
Udemy,2015-08-12T06:27:09.051Z,5,"UDEMY is an awesome website, I've personally learned a lot more in 1 week of web and graphic design than I would of in college."
Udemy,2015-08-12T05:32:44.815Z,5,"I love Udemy because it is the WYSIWYG concept with user ratings to help you decide whether or not a course is worth taking.  Simple, effective, and very much worthwhile."
Udemy,2015-08-12T04:18:40.414Z,5,"I have had the opportunity to enroll in a number of Udemy Online Courses and I like what I see. You can spend as little or as much as you want to learn current technologies. Whether to advance your knowledge to gain a better paying job or just to quell that curiosity about how something works, you will be happy to pick up some new knowledge that will be of use. Instructors are constantly updating their courses to keep them current, and many of the Instructors will respond to questions posted in course chats. Many also supply working files that you can use to follow along in an interactive way. Whether a Beginner, and Intermediate, or and Advanced Student, you can refresh and expand your knowledge."
Udemy,2015-08-12T04:16:52.869Z,4,Udemy has really good courses and they are affordable. They are responsive if there are any issues. Great organization.
Udemy,2015-08-12T03:54:31.613Z,5,"I've completed several courses on Udemy and have several others just waiting for me to make time to complete them. I've found great courses to help sharpen my skills with Microsoft Excel and courses to introduce me to drawing. There are so many interesting topics of study on Udemy and it only seems to be growing. I've rarely been disappointed with a course. I really like the fact that once you pay for a course, it's yours for life to view and re-view as many times as you like. I recommend Udemy to all my friends and co-workers and sadly, very few of them give it a chance. I feel bad for them."
Udemy,2015-08-12T03:03:38.201Z,5,You can find anything at good promotional prices
Udemy,2015-08-12T02:57:27.442Z,5,Udemy is perfect to share your knowledge with others and getting good money for it. I can highly recommend this platform.
Udemy,2015-08-12T02:51:51.871Z,5,There are many courses that can enhance skills and give a lot more to the confidence to work out towards our goal.
Udemy,2015-08-12T02:29:05.021Z,5,"this is the best website , i will definitely recommend to any one who is willing to learn,they have lots of subjects to learn , and price structure is also very good , you don't have to pay monthly , once you buy it and yours forever"
Udemy,2015-08-12T02:28:28.756Z,4,It is a good platform for new and experience learner. I myself benefited much with this.
Udemy,2015-08-12T02:11:28.760Z,5,"PROSAll training courses are structured wellMajority of lecturers have acceptable english to understand what they are teachingUnlimited time to complete courses.ConsSome courses like Excel are presented using Excel 2010, I use 2013, different versions created training problems and the headings do not tell you the version used.Some lecturers have such strong accents that it is hard to understand their English to completely learn the course with complete understanding."
Udemy,2015-08-12T02:07:59.310Z,5,I enjoy learning from the short video clips and concise information presented with these classes. I use many different classes depending on my interest at the time to continue growing my business.
Udemy,2015-08-12T02:06:42.109Z,5,Best online learning site
Udemy,2015-08-12T02:05:02.236Z,5,"I am a lifetime learner. I enjoy studying new skills that interests me. I've been to some sites that propose online courses and I found that Udemy is a unique education platform where anybody in this planet can share his or her expertise (whatever the skill is) with everybody else around the world. Another thing that I find interesting is that the courses also growing and updated from time to time. Not to mention the growing network of all the participants : the instructors, the students, supporting each other. I can predict that Udemy network will be bigger and bigger and Udemy has to prepare its system to overcome the problems so that every member could still access it as smooth as it is now."
Udemy,2015-08-12T02:02:06.254Z,5,"There are many things to learn. And it's very cheap compare to old school channel. Especially, when you buy courses on sales. Great!!!"
Udemy,2015-08-12T02:01:00.771Z,5,udemy it good teacher you can learn any thins you want in any time
Udemy,2015-08-12T01:30:47.790Z,5,I have been using UDEMY for a few years now and I cannot be more satisfied with the courses.  I first heard about them on a segment of the 6:00 news and I decided to look into it and have been a customer ever since.  I even have a t-shirt that was sent to me and when I where it many times I get asked what is UDEMY and I tell them about it and suggest they check it out.  They are alway having specials with discounted prices and there is a large variety of courses to choose from.  You have the ability to get certificates and many of the course offer perks with them.  This is the best place to take online courses.  I will be a customer for life.
Udemy,2015-08-12T01:30:43.743Z,5,"There are excellent courses here than can help you with your career, if you put the work into it. Will your employers look at the certificates? probably not. However they will look at the work you produce sometimes. I took a VBA course and got a couple jobs explaining some of the skills. Are all the courses flippin fantastic? No. There are a few here that are awful, but that's on par w/ everywhere else. You need to research before you buy. Check out the reviews. Check out what's already available free on teh interwebs and compare it to the subject matter in the course you are interested in. Then check out the untimed previews. THEN take a 5 minute preview and quickly go through a few topics you really want to know in a course. See if the instructor is just reading notes to put you to sleep (don't buy!!) or if they are Demonstrating skills (buy!). The majority demonstrate. But once you hit a few losers that just read bedtime material for insomniacs (reading slides, powerpoints, websites, reviewing software w/o actually demonstrating etc.), you wise up. Is udemy good? no, it's great! it raised my income. Are All the courses great? no, don't buy willy nilly, research what you buy first- just like everything else you buy. You don't go to a 7 or 18 hour movie w/o first knowing if you're interested in it, right?? treat this the same way."
Udemy,2015-08-12T01:16:45.290Z,5,"Udemy is one of the best learning tools out there. Great concept, and courses are very affordable."
Udemy,2015-08-12T00:57:24.921Z,5,A very nice resource for freelancers who wants to insights and lectures from pro's
Udemy,2015-08-12T00:49:02.789Z,5,"I have taken over two dozen Udemy tutorials and I was only disappointed one time, but that was an instructor issue, NOT Udemy. Udemy courses are easy to follow and understand. Plus, there is the added benefit of downloading the lectures to view at your leisure. I also appreciate that a majority of the instructors provided downloadable reference materials and information. I highly recommend checking out Udemy!"
Udemy,2015-08-12T00:27:11.517Z,5,I'm addicted to this site and I have learned a lot with it's high quality content.  If you could team up with universities for certification would be an excellent sell argument.
Udemy,2015-08-12T00:21:37.773Z,3,"Pros :1 - Very good courses.2 - GREAT discounts on courses over the year !3 - The community is awesome Cons :1 - I have problems with the HTML5 player . I have uninstalled flash player . Still asks me to download it to watch the videos even if I choose HTML5 player from settings ... the only way to watch my courses is to download them using application ."
Udemy,2015-08-11T23:40:09.882Z,5,Everyone should take advantage of the available classes on Udemy. Continued learning is key to continued growth and brain functionality.
Udemy,2015-08-11T23:24:21.244Z,5,"Udemy is a site rich with opportunity for those who are enterprising and self-motivated who have a marketable talent or skill. I wish there were centralized sources of ""how-to"" manual and videos that systematically and thoroughly lay out the procedures, rules, and resources necessary for teachers to produce great, marketable courses."
Udemy,2015-08-11T23:22:22.637Z,5,Great way to further develop skills at one's own pace. Brilliant
Udemy,2015-08-11T23:04:58.750Z,4,"I'm really glad that I found Udemy, because I was starting to spend way too much money in brick-and-morter classroom settings to fill some gaps in my basic design skill sets. There, I had to pick and choose from what little was offered; and I had to be in a specific space at a set time, with no opportunity to repeat the experience as needed. With Udemy, I've found a wide range of courses: covering what I need to learn in order to update my skill sets, and, a number of special interests I just enjoy learning more about. There are basic FREE courses to get started with, and a range of paid courses to cover topics from a variety of angles. I found I was able to map out a pathway toward where I need to be with my marketable skill sets, updating established skills and building upon my hands-on work experience to keep competitive with newer workers in the field. Lots of great course sales, too; but what is most exciting to me is that I have been able to taylor my learning experience to meet my own specific needs. There are a lot of great, passionate teachers on Udemy, too; and maybe there is the odd person just out to make a buck but where are you NOT going to find that happening! I have recommended Udemy to co-workers who need to fill in some gaps in their skill sets, and I would not hesitate to recommend Udemy to anyone I wanted to help get ahead in life. I'm really glad I found Udemy — an excellent resource in the knowledge economy!"
Udemy,2015-08-11T23:02:19.003Z,5,Simply one place that makes everyone life easier to find a good course and making it always available.
Udemy,2015-08-11T22:48:55.487Z,5,"I love all of the various courses at all levels. They have GREAT free courses, and SO many courses at a huge range of prices. I am sure that I have WAY too many, but try to watch them when I can."
Udemy,2015-08-11T22:46:53.411Z,5,"I Stumbled across Udemy about a year ago and I'm glad that I did. There are plenty of free high quality courses done by instructors who have good experience in that subject. If you are looking at doing a specific job, then looking at the Udemy courses are a good way of seeing what is involved by instructors who do this everyday and learn some tricks of the trade as well. I have taken subjects that I didn't know anything about and I now have a good understanding in those areas.I listen to the courses at work, ones that are basically audio with only a small amount of video used as I do my work. I have built up a library of courses (150) which I am going through the non technical ones first. The selection of subjects is comprehensive, from art, business, programming languages, project management, science to astronomy. The courses are normally for life access and some courses are being further developed from the feedback of students to benefit all students. The programming courses tend to be more a hands on approach with doing a specific lecture and then experimenting yourself, so these courses take a lot more time to finish. So anytime you are relaxed, switch on your computer or tablet or your mobile and starting learning something new."
Udemy,2015-08-11T22:46:19.693Z,5,"if you are looking to learn a good course at a reasonable price...udemy is the best place to visit...:) :)  still can regulate the price of some of the courses..but no complaints so far..."
Udemy,2015-08-11T22:41:55.510Z,5,I've taken some courses here and plan on doing some more. All of them are really high quality and fairly priced.
Udemy,2015-08-11T22:24:09.040Z,5,Udemy has top instructors for most if not all courses. I am always looking for new courses to register and learn @Udemy
Udemy,2015-08-11T22:22:20.713Z,5,"My experience with Udemy all started when I was looking on how to make games without coding. I finally found a course that did just that and various other courses have all been very impressive. I' am extremely grateful and know it is a answer to pray. God really lead me to this website and I give Him all glory and praise. I was praying for many years for courses I could take in business and there are so many wonderful things to learn on Udemy. I believe what makes it stand out most though is the coupons and how much of the time you can get any course for $10 to $19 dollars. I always felt I could pay full price but it was so good to know that I could get a good deal on these courses because I always planned to take more then just a few courses. So with so much to choose from it really is the best thing you can do, is sign up with Udemy. What amazes me about them is that they could easily charge people a fee every month for offering so many fantastic courses but they don't and its free! Also many courses are free so even if your on a tight budget you can always find courses to take with no charge. Personal thanks to Udemy for creating this website. It really has changed so many peoples lives, building bridges between instructors and students all in one convenient place, I don't see why I go anywhere else! Too many great deals going on here! I can tell you for certain you can trust Udemy and the instructors on here. Udemy is very careful with who can be a instructor and even though everyone can make a course on here it does not mean they are all accepted. This keeps the scammers out and helps keep everything real."
Udemy,2015-08-11T22:05:15.069Z,5,"Several years ago, I was looking for some tips that would help me to survive my rookie year of teaching and I discovered Udemy. I got hooked. Since then, I have taken countless courses and I was able to start my own tutoring business, build my brand, connect with experts, market my services, start another successful business, and more. There are so many courses right now and it's getting hard to find the top quality ones, but with a little research, you can get so much value that it's definitely worth it."
Udemy,2015-08-11T21:56:19.482Z,5,A great site for online courses. Recommended.
Udemy,2015-08-11T21:55:18.061Z,5,In the platform Udemy always find current and high quality courses at affordable prices thanks Udemy for being part of my educational development
Udemy,2015-08-11T21:50:26.580Z,5,"Udemy has been a great experience for me. I joined several courses on Udemy to learn how to improve my income earning potential after I was left alone to care for my two children. With no degree and no job experience, I was able to begin earning decent revenue within the first month. That inspired me to become an instructor myself and teach others the skills I have as a baker. My course has done extremely well and Udemy has been there every step of the way, being supportive in whatever way I needed. They have a great platform, the learning is fun and the company is forward thinking, friendly and very helpful. I would  recommend Udemy to anyone thinking of learning or teaching."
Udemy,2015-08-11T21:50:24.080Z,5,"I have used Udemy for years, and I absolutely love it.  The courses are very reasonable, and are very transparent.  As with anything else, there are people that are trying to just make money selling courses, but Udemy takes on all the risk by offering a full 30-day satisfaction guarantee.  I have used it only a couple of times, and not always because of the quality of the course - sometimes, you find a course just isn't for you. They still refund you, no questions asked. NO RISK!  Anyways, I am approaching 100 courses on Udemy. Everything from programming to aquaponic gardening to speed reading.  I couldn't be more happy with the service, and I use the site and my courses at least 5 days a week."
Udemy,2015-08-11T21:48:45.737Z,5,"i had MANY courses on UDEMYEACH is of high standers in content , sound, videosthank you"
Udemy,2015-08-11T21:44:03.272Z,5,"With the possibility to choose from a large amount of courses, Udemy creates the possibility to learn new or improve your skills."
Udemy,2015-08-11T21:32:57.983Z,3,"My experience with Udemy is highs and lows.  Some courses are EXCELLENT resources for learning new skills.  Other courses leave a lot to be desired.  Of course the ratings system helps some, but not always.  Video lessons online via my computer are excellent quality.  However, an attempt to download courses to my tablet for offline viewing proved futile and the Udemy customer service team was no help at all in this situation."
Udemy,2015-08-11T21:31:50.906Z,5,"Udemy is wonderful platform for those who want to improve their skills, you can find so many courses related to every skill taught by highly professional instructors. There are also course which are completely useless, people are promoting their product(s), such as affiliate marketers whose only purpose is to promote the product or get sales. My overall experience with Udemy is very good."
Udemy,2015-08-11T21:30:42.141Z,5,"All my experience with udemy has been positive.

Udemy,2015-08-11T20:59:32.002Z,5,"Udemy is my daily source of learning. I use it to strengthen my skills, develop new ones and even discover topics that are not in my area of knowledge.The courses are organized on categories and subcategories - lots of them - and are provided by various instructors. Courses varies from around 30 minutes to few hours and are divided in shorter lessons. In most of cases, there are additional learning materials provided by instructors. Watch and learn as you wish - once registered in a course, free or paid, you'll have access to it for life. Don't stop learning and don't miss this great opportunity provided by Udemy!"

Udemy,2015-08-11T20:39:20.650Z,5,"I really like Udemy and the business model they have. Once you create the content and the course is ready, they focus a lot on advertising it and getting people to purchase it. It is great because when they win, you win (and the other way around). I also really like the customer service. They are very dedicated and helpful and will do everything they cam to help out. Furthermore, they have a huge amount of very helpful articles and guides. I love you Udemy"
Udemy,2015-08-11T20:39:16.869Z,5,"This is a great site to learn and share knowledge. Instructors are great and care for their students, courses are accessible 24x7 and some are updated regularly.There are courses for different levels of students, from novice to expert.Very useful, specially if you want to learn at your own pace. Students share their experiences and knowledge too, which adds a plus.Highly recommended!"
Udemy,2015-08-11T20:38:54.807Z,4,"Udemy is a great learning platform. They have most types of content on sale most times. Some of their authors aren't very thorough or knowledgeable however, so you have to be careful. For example their are courses priced at nearly $500 that aren't worth $5. Most times you can get courses for $10 though. It seems like every time there is a new way to make money people try to beat it to death with sub-par content."
Udemy,2015-08-11T20:32:58.157Z,5,"When someone eager to learn and be taught new ideas and experiences comes across Udemy you can only be pleased by the plethora of articles and courses at hand to assist your academic skills.Many tutors, one better than the other have invested in time zealously to hand out knowledge.Again the platform with which Udemy drives all the information is easy to handle, fast in reaction and with nice ux feeling.Keep the good work up."

Udemy,2015-08-11T20:27:47.882Z,5,"There is a minefield of courses out there. This can even be true for the particular path you decide to travel. Undoubtedly the majority of courses are excellent. I have never as yet taken any course where I have not learned something. Before purchasing a course, it is advisable to see what the course teaches as some titles can be misleading."
Udemy,2015-08-11T20:20:26.546Z,5,"I am absolutely thrilled to have heard about Udemy!  It has changed my life, by making it easier for me to learn new things, at my own speed.  Such great courses, I am sorry everyone doesn't know about this great resource that is available to us all.  I tell everyone that will listen about how great Udemy is and all they can learn.  Granted not everyone wants to hear about it, and you can tell they have just given up and don't want to learn anymore.  Well, that is not me.  If I could just take the whole day and learn from the courses, that would make me very happy.  But, alias...that is not what life is really like, so I take the time I do have that is free, and use it by learning more and more and more etc."
Udemy,2015-08-11T20:15:52.520Z,4,"Incredible team and tools and everything is just great and wonderful, only one thing , the fees... are a little too bigg"

I have recommended it to several friends who love it as well. The only disadvantage is that the videos sometimes load very slowly and I have to wait very long to be able to take a lesson. I hope this can get fixed soon.Apart from this, there is nothing bad I can say about Udemy. Congratulations to Udemy team for the site´s success and keep doing a great job!"

Udemy,2015-08-11T19:42:45.807Z,5,"As a student of numerous Udemy courses, I can honestly say it's been a brilliant experience. I'm so glad I discovered the Udemy platform. The courses are reasonably priced, with special offers quite frequently. Lessons are short so they can be fitted into odd moments. I often listen while I'm in the bathroom in the morning. There's the opportunity to ask the tutor questions and to interact with other students. On the rare occasion when I've had a general query, Udemy has responded quickly and helpfully. I've learned a lot of useful information that will help my video, photography, web design and social media marketing business. I hope to teach for Udemy soon and I'm sure that that experience will also be an excellent one. The instructions for becoming a tutor are laid out clearly and I know from the Facebook group, Udemy Studio, that Udemy tutors enjoy helping each other out and share tips and useful advice regularly. It's a very friendly, welcoming community."
Udemy,2015-08-11T19:38:12.859Z,5,"I love Udemy. It's a great platform to learn practically anything you want, for free or not. It helped me a lot as I can't follow a ""normal"" educational path."

I have gained so much knowledge through Udemy courses that I have built the courage to teach myself. The platform and the community encourage to make learning a habit and teaching a profession that was once considered to be a job for underdogs. With so many success stories to learn from, one can make a living out of Udemy and quit their day job."

Udemy,2015-08-11T19:51:07.189Z,5,"I love Udemy, every course I had is very good.  I can download and watch videos on my ipad with speed control.  Suggestions to improve.1.  Make it possible for us to watch on a PC with speed control2.  Make it possible for us to watch on android with speed control.Tip to fellow learners.1.  With the 10 dollar coupons it could be a better place for a learner than an instructor.  2. Use common sense, some instructors are clearly trying to cash in with junk, if you see a flashy course with popular titles like ""Hacking ..."" For $149.00 But the course is only an hour or two long be suspicious.3.  Any course under 2 hours should be free.  To learn anything is going to take more than 10 hours.  Many instructors offer great detailed courses 8, 10 or even more hours long with a $10 dollar coupon.With that said I love the freedom instructors have, to do and charge what they want,  the best will get to the top."
Udemy,2015-08-11T19:18:11.366Z,5,Trying to compete in the Telecom design industry requires constant knowledge of current technologies.  Udemy is a great training tool for me to keep pace with the rapid advancements in my field.
